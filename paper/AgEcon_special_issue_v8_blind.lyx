\begin_layout Title
Leading the way - Foreign Direct Investment and dairy value chain upgrading
 in Uganda
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Driven by increased demand from both local and export markets and facilitated
 by far-reaching liberalization and privatization policies, the dairy sub-sector
 in Uganda has undergone significant changes in the last decade.
 With a comparative advantage in milk production, the southwest of Uganda
 has started to attract considerable Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in
 processing capacity, mainly targeting the export market.
 As a result, processing capacity increased five-fold and dairy became Uganda's
 third most important export product, coming from negligible amounts a decade
 earlier.
 In this study, we use data collected at different nodes within the value
 chain to identify some of the key innovations in these value chains.
 This is done by comparing the area that received the bulk of FDI to a similar
 area that did not.
 Furthermore, we also provide an econometric analysis that focuses on the
 integration of value chain actors into modern value chains more broadly
 defined.
 We find that dairy value chains are transforming rapidly, but innovations
 are more pronounced in areas that received the bulk of FDI.
 Our analysis further underscores the importance of milk collection centers,
 which often take the form of farmer cooperatives, in providing many of
 the support services that enable other actors in the value chain to produce
 sufficient milk, and maintain milk sanitation levels necessary for a modern
 export sector to emerge.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Agricultural value chains are rapidly changing in developing countries,
 also in Africa

, but the nature and causes of these changes – and especially the role of
 Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) – are not well understood.
 Various studies find that FDI has been a major diver of the upgrading of
 value chains in a number of developing countries, for instance through
 relaxing capital constraints and facilitating transfer of technology and
 know-how

.
 In the case of the dairy sector, investments by multinational companies
 can lead to important and quick upgrading of value chains 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we document trends in FDI, modernization, and innovation
 in the case of dairy value chain transformation in Uganda.
 Uganda is an interesting case as the dairy value chain has undergone substantia
l and rapid changes as seen by a number of indicators
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
However, these changes have mostly gone unnoticed.
 The dairy sub-sector in Uganda was traditionally not considered a strategic
 sector.
 As a result, in the Bank of Uganda's statistics, dairy exports are amalgamated
 into a category together with other non-traditional exports, obscuring
 the evolution of the sector.
 Practitioners in the sector have been trying to get the attention of politician
s through the local press 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "eg."
key "New2"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 and the research community also started to pick an interest in the evolution
 in the sector

.
 First, national production has increased by more than 50 percent in the
 last decade, from 1.4 to 2.2 billion liters annually.
 Second, there has been quick modernization in dairy value chains through
 large investments in processing plants – for the large majority through
 FDI – leading to a five-fold increase in processing capacity (to about
 2.5 million liters per day) over the last 10 years.
 Third, while a decade ago, Uganda imported more dairy products than it
 exported, in 2018 dairy had become Uganda’s third most important export
 product.
 Fourth, while good recent data are lacking, available household surveys
 suggests that dairy consumption has increased substantially: As regional
 poverty has decreased dramatically, higher incomes resulted in rapidly
 increasing consumption of dairy products, which are known to be highly
 income elastic

key "COLEN2018116,10.1093/jn/133.11.3907S"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Especially in cities, consumers are confronted with an increasing availability
 of various dairy products such as milk, yogurt and ice cream in both informal
 shops and emerging supermarkets, and consumers become increasingly aware
 of the health benefits of dairy products

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Interestingly, due to a combination of agglomeration effects and a comparative
 advantage in milk production, the transformation was more outspoken in
 the so-called southwestern milk shed.
 Most of the FDI was concentrated here, and as a result, this area has become
 tightly integrated in a global export-led value chain, with large processors
 sourcing raw milk from farmers and converting raw milk into complex products
 with a long shelf life, such as Ultra High Temperature (UHT) treated milk
 and powder milk.
 At the same time, a nearby area similar in agro-ecological conditions and
 with similar aggregate production levels and referred to as the central
 milk shed, has become the main supplier for dairy products for the local
 market.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we set out to document the technological and institutional
 innovations that are associated with value chain upgrading.
 However, value chain transformation is an endogenous process.
 While it is not always clear what innovations are the cause or the result
 of value chain transformation, the co-existence of both export-led and
 domestic market-led value chains for the same commodity in a single country
 provides an interesting case, and may shed some light on critical innovations
 by comparing technological, institutional and organizational features in
 these two locations.
 Generally, studies on value chain transformation in developing countries
 analyze either export-led chains for commodities with little or no local
 market 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "maertens2009trade,maertens2009horticulture,minten2009global"

\end_inset

 or domestic chains 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "minten2016feeding,JANSSEN2019327"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 This makes it difficult to identify which innovations are most important
 in both driving and enabling value chain upgrading, as the context may
 be too dissimilar.
 In this study, we will compare value chains from the southwestern milk
 shed to value chains from the central milk shed and document differences
 in key technological and institutional dynamics.
 At the same time, we acknowledge the limits of using exposure of value
 chain actors to FDI in the vicinity as a proxy for value chain transformation.
 Indeed, there may be dairy farmers located in the southwestern milk shed
 that supply only to the local market, just as well as there are likely
 to be traders operating in the central milk shed that ship to processors
 that export.
 We thus also present an alternative analysis where the focus is more on
 integration in modern value chains.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our study mainly relies on primary data, supplemented with data from secondary
 sources.
 The primary data was collected at different nodes in the value chain.
 Upstream, we interviewed farmers that produce milk, most of it for the
 market.
 These farmers generally sell raw milk at the farm gate to traders, the
 second category of actors we collected data from.
 Traders and transporters in turn, ship this unprocessed milk mostly to
 milk collection centers, the third category of actors we interviewed.
 Another important actor in the dairy value chain is the processor, who
 sources milk mostly from milk collection centers.
 We collected qualitative data from two processors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that milk collection centers are an important facilitator of value
 chain upgrading.
 They help guarantee that processors can source the quantity of quality
 milk they need to compete on the international and modern local market.
 At the same time, they provide a stable outlet for producers (either directly
 or indirectly through middlemen).
 Often, these centers appear to do more than just bulking and chilling milk.
 They also provide a range of services to farmers that enable and sustain
 additional innovations upstream.
 For example, milk collection centers also assist farmers with medicines
 and vacations, enabling farmers to adopt improved cross-bred cows that
 produce more milk but are also much more susceptible to pests and diseases.
 They are also important for quality assurance.
 Often they provide milk cans to their suppliers.
 Many milk collection centers are cooperatives, which may be an effective
 organizational form to safeguard collective reputation in cases where traceabil
ity is hard and provide loyalty when side-selling is an attractive option.
 We further observe a shift from informal to formal value chain financing
 and the adoption of rotational grazing practices.
 While these innovations are most pronounced in the southwestern milk shed
 that received the bulk of FDI and is geared mostly toward export, some
 of these changes also seem to happen in the central milk shed that supplies
 the local market, albeit at a lower pace.
 This may indicate that also for the case of Ugandan dairy value chains,
 FDI facilitates transfer of technology and know-how, leading to a more
 efficient and inclusive sub-sector as a whole.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the fact that this study allows for the direct comparison
 of two different types of value chains for a single commodity and in the
 same context, it is also important for the following reasons.
 First, with almost 700 small traders interviewed, our study provides evidence
 on the behavior of a group of value chain actors that are hard to capture
 and often misunderstood 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "sitko2014exploitative"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Second, we collected data on almost 100 milk collection centers, an institution
 that is specific to the sub-sector.
 In most other value chain studies, the sample size for similar value chain
 actors is generally much lower
\begin_inset Foot

 surveys cold storage facilities in the potato value chain in Bihar, India.
 However, they only interviewed 27 storage owners.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Third, while there is a substantial gray literature on dairy value chains
 in Uganda, most of these rely on qualitative data and are limited in terms
 of representativeness.
 Finally, and more broadly, the important role that aggregators and other
 actors in the midstream play in facilitating farmer access to training
 and other services is yet to be well established in the development literature,
 broadly and agricultural economics more specifically.
 The role that midstream actors play in facilitating technology adoption
 and upgrading supports some key considerations highlighted in several recent
 papers

 study based on rigorous empirical analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rest of this article is organized as follows.
 The next section uses secondary data to highlight the drivers behind the
 transformation of the dairy sub-sector.
 We point out potential demand side drivers and explain how policy reforms
 created an enabling environment for considerable FDI.
 We then describe the structure of the value chain and explain how raw milk
 flows through the value chain.
 We then turn to important innovations that we observe within the value
 chain.
 We first describe differences between the export oriented milk shed and
 the area that is supplying the local market.
 We identify milk collection centers as an important innovation, and also
 look at technology adoption among farmer, dynamics in value chain financing,
 feeding practices, and quality assurance.
 We also experiment with an alternative indicator of integration into modern
 dairy value chains and compare a range of innovations within this chain
 to traditional configurations using more formal models in an econometric
 analysis.
 A final section concludes.

\begin_layout Section
Drivers of dairy value chain transformation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dairy sub-sector in Uganda has grown substantially.
 According to the Uganda Dairy Development Authority (DDA), annual milk
 production has increased from 1.4 billion liters of milk in 2006 to 2.2 billion
 liters in 2017/2018.
 The expansion of the sub-sector is driven by an increase in demand, both
 from within Uganda as well as from abroad.
 At the same time, pro-market policy reforms encouraged investment in the
 sub-sector

Local consumption

\begin_layout Standard
Consumption of dairy products has been increasing over time in Uganda.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 shows yearly per capita liquid milk consumption in liters as estimated
 using four different waves of the Uganda National Household Survey (UNHS).
 We see that according to this data, as recent as 2001/02, the average Ugandan
 consumed only about 12 liter of milk per person per year.
 At that time, consumption in rural and urban areas was virtually the same.
 By 2012/13, average consumption per capita had doubled.
 The figure shows that most of the increase in milk consumption is due to
 an increase in demand in urban areas, reaching 33 liters per capita per
 year in 2012/13.
 In rural areas, milk consumption seems to fluctuate between 10 and 20 liters
 per capita per year.

[Bart]Are these the most recent data? A lot of action happened since.
 In the talk with the DDA guy, it see in my notes that he mentioned an increase
 of dairy consumption from 20 l/person/day to 70 l/person/day over the last
 15 years.
 If these are official data, they could possibly be triangulated to show
 somehow dramatically increased consumption.
 [Bjorn] will check if I can find the UNHS 2015/16.
 But DDA figures are indeed much higher, but I do not trust their statistics.
 I think they take averages of only households that report consuming milk
 (and drop all the zeros).

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The consumption reported in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Consumption-of-liquid"

\end_inset

 captures only liquid milk.
 However, Ugandans also consume dairy products in other forms.
 For instance, in rural areas, 
\emph on
bongo
\emph default
, a type of buttermilk that can be stored longer than liquid milk, is very
 popular
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Often, milk that can not be sold is processed into bongo.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, in rural areas, butter (or ghee) and yogurt consumption is
 taking off.
 Unfortunately, the UNHS only records milk and ghee consumption; there is
 no separate category for
\emph on
 bongo
\emph default
.
 Primary data collected from about 1,600 milk farmers in the central and
 southwestern milk shed (which will be described in detail later) suggests
 that more than half of the farmers consume bongo on a regular basis and
 the amounts consumed are only slightly lower than those of milk.
 As a result, the consumption of dairy products may be substantially higher
 than what is reported in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Consumption-of-liquid"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More in general, providing reliable estimates of local dairy consumption
 is not straightforward.
 While the UNHS is arguable the most credible source when estimating consumption
 expenditure, dairy consumption in Uganda is very low, with the vast majority
 of households reporting no consumption of milk in the last 7 days, which
 is the consumption recall period in the UNHS.
 Per capita consumption estimates quoted in the popular press or estimated
 in case studies often differ widely, with sources not always well documented.
 For instance, one of the figures mostly quoted is 62 liters per capita
 in 2017 (up from 25 liters in 1986).
 However, it is not clear how this was estimated and what data source was
 used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Export sector
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not only national consumption has increased.
 Over time, and especially since 2014 after the establishment of various
 processing plants in the southwestern milk shed, dairy exports have increased
 exponentially (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Import-and-export"

\end_inset

).
 The latest available data, obtained from the DDA, show that US$ 130 million
 worth of dairy products have been exported in 2017.
 The DDA reports that almost half of the export value, US$ 55 million, was
 exported by a single processor (Pearl Dairy – See Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Largest-exporters-in"

\end_inset

).
 This processor exports mostly milk powder to countries on the Arabian peninsula
, but also to Nigeria.
 About 20 percent of the total export value is exported to mostly neighboring
 countries through Brookside Ltd.
 Birunga Dairies Industries, located in the Southwestern tip of Uganda (and
 outside our study area), exports about US$ 18 million worth of milk to
 the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi and Rwanda.
 Amos Dairies Ltd focuses on casein exports to the United states (US$ 11
 million).
 Smaller processors such as Lakeside Diaries Ltd.
 specialize in other locations such as South Sudan.

 was hesitant about the future of the dairy sub-sector in Uganda as a strong
 export oriented sector, pointing out that informality of relationships
 constrained the development of contractual interactions, resulting in supply
 uncertainties at the level of the processors.
 Dairy was also not considered a priority sector for export by the government,
 yet today dairy has become the third most important export product, after
 coffee (US$ 555 million) and fish (US$ 140 million), and leaves other tradition
al export sectors such as tea (US$ 80 million) and flowers (US$ 60 million)
 trailing behind.
 Uganda's dairy exports are now similar to South Africa.

\begin_layout Standard
The transformation of the dairy sub-sector in Uganda was also driven by
 a range of policy reforms.
 In the past, the (formal) dairy sector was heavily centralized, and all
 milk needed to pass through the National Dairy Corporation, a parastatal
 dairy processor.
 The privatization push of the new government of Museveni that came to power
 in 1986 also impacted the dairy sector.
 One of the first milestones was the passing of the Dairy Industry Act in
 parliament in 1998, which established the Dairy Development Authority (DDA).
 This entity was set up to create an enabling environment for the sector
 and assumed the dual role of both promoting dairy production and regulating
 the industry.
 However, it was only in 2006 that the National Dairy Corporation was privatized
, and even then, the state monopoly was simply replaced by another monopoly:
 the National Dairy Corporation was bought by Sameer Agriculture and Livestock
 (SAL) Ltd., and as part of the deal, SAL also acquired all the coolers that
 were part of the cold chain.
 This left smallholder milk producers with few options other than selling
 to SAL at very low prices 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This monopoly did not last long.
 The government, with a president hailing from one of the most important
 milk producing areas in the country, actively promoted the development
 of the sector by encouraging dairy farmers to unite in cooperatives and
 set up their own milk collection centers.
 Furthermore, Uganda facilitated international trade relationships in different
 ways.
 Through various tax breaks (as well as giving free land), FDI into dairy
 processing capacity was lured in and they now make up the large majority
 of processing capacity in the country.
 Some of these investors were attracted by low production costs in Uganda
 but they were also interested due to problems for their operations in other
 countries.
 For example, Amos reportedly invested in Uganda, because price wars in
 liquid milk markets in India led to low margins in their domestic market

 The creation of the East African Community further meant easier trade with
 neighboring countries and had as a consequence that milk, which can be
 produced relatively cheaply in Uganda, was in high demand in neighboring
 countries, Kenya in particular.
 That said, there are still substantial policy related uncertainties.
 Tanzania, for example, keeps protecting its local dairy market with large
 import duties.
 Furthermore, during an extended drought in 2017, Kenya temporarily introduced
 duties on imported milk.

Uganda's privatization push also affected livestock farmers directly.
 Traditionally, livestock farmers in the cattle belt, a semi-arid area that
 stretches from the southwest all the way to the northeast of the country,
 were nomadic pastorals.
 They roamed across communal land, seeking forage and water.
 Especially for the Ankole tribe of southwestern Uganda, livestock is an
 important part of their cultural identity, and prestige is derived from
 the size of the herd.
 The herd was depended upon for subsistence, and only if cash was needed,
 occasionally animals were sold.
 However, as a result of privatization and population pressure, communal
 lands were fenced off, depriving nomadic farmers from grazing land and,
 more importantly, water sources.
 This gradually led to a shift away from livestock ownership as a store
 of wealth toward a more commercially oriented, sedentary livestock sub-sector,
 where maximization of productivity of cattle became the main objective

Structure of the value chain
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Uganda is divided into so-called milk sheds, each with different characteristics
 in terms of agro-ecological conditions, farm typologies and market dynamics.
 The southwestern milk shed around Mbarara and the central milk shed comprising
 of the districts Kyankwanzi, Kiboga and Nakaseke, are the two most important
 milk sheds (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Map-of-Uganda"

\end_inset

).
 While the agro-ecological conditions and farmer types are pretty similar
 between the two sheds, market dynamics are very different.
 In the southwestern milk shed, low prices have attracted processors that
 are able to compete in the international market.
 This has pushed the supply base for the local dairy value chain that supplies
 Kampala to the central milk shed.

There are many actors involved in the dairy value chain.
 Upstream, there are the producers who produce for own consumption, but
 also sell significant amounts of milk.
 Often, these are small producers that reside in rural areas.
 Small traders and transporters collect milk in villages at the farm gate
 daily, and transport this to milk collection centers using bicycles or
 motorbikes, or occasionally, a pick-up truck.
 Milk collection centers bulk the milk in coolers for further transport
 to processors or consumer markets.
 There is also a range of actors that provide services to the dairy supply
 chain, such as veterinary services, or inputs such as feeding supplements.
 Finally, milk is consumed in different forms and by different consumers,
 ranging from farmers and their neighbors in the village that consume raw
 milk, to consumers in the US that use products based on the casein protein
 extracted from milk (glue, paint,...).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We collected survey data on three value chain actors.
 In total, we collected data on 1,600 milk producers, 700 traders and 100
 milk collection centers.
 We started by selecting 14 sub-counties from six districts (Mbarara, Kiruhura,
 Kyankwanzi, Kiboga, Nakaseke and Masindi).
 These sub-counties were selected to reflect geographic dispersion of actors
 within the value chain.
 We proceeded with a two stage random sampling strategy, where first villages
 were selected with probability proportional to the number of households
 residing in the village.
 In each selected village, we then consulted village household lists to
 randomly select farmers.
 The number of households selected within each village was again proportional
 to the total number of households residing in the village
\begin_inset Foot

 animals, the next household on the list was selected.

 However, sampling traders is hard due to their mobile nature and we agree

 lead to an overestimate of role and importance of traders that supply milk
 collection centers (as opposed to traders that supply processors directly,
 milk-shops,...).

 The average farmer in the central milk shed sells about 84 liter of milk
 per week (measured in the week before the survey, which was at the onset
 of the dry season).
 Just under half of this, 40 liters or about 48 percent, is sold to traders.
 Farmers also sell milk to milk collection centers, either directly (18
 liters of 21 percent of sales), or by contracting a transporter to take
 the milk from the farm-gate to the milk collection center (15 liters or
 about 18 percent)

 Finally, about 10 liters, corresponding to almost 12 percent of all milk
 marketed, is sold directly to neighbours.
 Farmers in the southwestern milk shed sell double of what farmers in the
 central milk shed bring to the market (163 liters of milk per week).
 Also here, small traders that collect milk in the rural areas are very
 important, buying up more than half of all marketed milk (86 liters or
 almost 53 percent of all milk marketed).
 This share is significantly higher than in the central shed (at the 10
 percent significance level – p-value: 0.088).
 One quarter of the milk is directly sold to milk collection centers (42
 liters per week or 26 percent), and this share is also significantly lower
 in the central milk shed (p-value: 0.084).
 The use of transport services is, relative to the central shed, somewhat
 less important in the southwestern milk shed, but the difference is not
 significant.
 Consistent with our expectations of finding a more informal supply chain
 in the center, direct sales to neighbours are significantly lower in the
 southwestern milk shed.

We next estimate how much of the quantities that traders and transporters
 procure (55 liters in the central shed and 112 liters in the southwestern
 shed) is distributed over actors further downstream.
 In the central milk shed, traders almost exclusively ship to milk collection
 centers (48 liters, amounting to 87 percent of milk procured).
 The remaining 7 liters is shared between processors (3 liters), milk shops
 (3 liters), and direct sales to villagers (1 liter).
 Trader behaviour is clearly different in the southwestern milk shed.
 Apart from supplying milk to milk collection centers (80 liters, which
 is proportionally less than in the central shed), relatively more milk
 is delivered to milk shops (19 liters).
 Traders selling to villagers also seems not uncommon in the southwest (5
 liters).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the next step, we estimate how the quantities collected by milk collection
 centers (66 liter in the central shed and 122 liter in the southwestern
 shed) are disposed of.
 In both sheds, most milk goes to processors.
 Interestingly, in the central milk shed, milk collection centers also seem
 to be important to sustain local milk consumption, as 21 percent of the
 milk is sold to villagers (14 liters).
 In the southwestern milk shed, sales by milk collection centers to villagers
 is marginal (3 liters).
 In the southwest, milk collection centers also often sell to large traders
 (21 liters, representing 17 percent of total sales by the milk collection
 center).
 These traders generally take milk to the processor Brookside Ltd.
 in Kampala.
 While milk collection centers from the center also sell to traders, this
 is relatively less important (6 liters or about 10 percent of total milk
 sold by the milk collection center).
 Finally, fierce competition for supplies in the southwest means that processors
 will also buy non-negligible amounts of milk directly from traders (8 liters).

Innovations in dairy value chains
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we document various innovations that characterize the dairy
 value chain transformation.
 We want to reiterate the endogenous nature of these innovations, where
 a particular innovation may both drive value chain upgrading and at the
 same time be a result of it.
 For example, the extent to which a farmer is integrated in modern commercial
 value chains and his level of technology adoption is determined simultaneously.
 Innovating farmers may be more likely to participate in modern value chains
 simply because they are more likely to produce a stable marketable surplus

 Processors in modern value chains may have stringent quality standards
 which only innovating farmers can guarantee 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 At the same time, poorly functioning input and output markets erode the

 Integration into modern value chains may make new technologies profitable
 for various reasons.
 The endogenous value chain dynamics make it difficult to identify causal
 relationships and so one should avoid attributing causality to the associations
 we uncover in the following sections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Descriptive analysis – export-led versus local demand-led value chains
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start by comparing actors located and operating in the export oriented
 southwestern milk shed to the central milk shed to assess the importance
 of various innovations in modernizing the dairy value chain.
 As mentioned above, the two milk sheds are both located in the cattle belt
 and share the same agro-ecology.
 According to the DDA, they are also very similar in aggregate production:
 the southwestern milk shed produces 25 percent of all milk, while this
 is 24 percent for the central milk shed.
 Our data also suggests that farmer typology is similar in both sheds: the
 average farmer has about 30 cows and has access to about 45 acres of land.
 However, we do not have accurate data on differences in infrastructure
 between the two sheds.
 In fact, some data we collected in our survey that may be useful to get
 a sense of differences in infrastructure suggests there may be some.
 For instance, we find that the average distance from a household to the
 nearest all weather road is significantly higher in the central milk shed
 than in the southwestern milk shed.
 Therefore, it bears repeating that the innovations we document below may
 also be the consequence of differences in infrastructure (or any other
 unobserved confounder) between the two milk sheds.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Milk collection centers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Milk collection centers are central actors in modern dairy value chains.
 They consist of structures that have the infrastructure in place to bulk
 and chill the milk as it waits for further transport.
 Generally, milk collection centers form the start of the cold chain.
 Often, these centers are located in rural areas where production of milk
 is high.
 At the same time, it is also important that milk tankers can reach the
 center to further transport the milk down the value chain.
 Most centers power their coolers using generators.
 While milk collection centers are certainly not new or even unique to Uganda
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "eg. see"

, the innovation lies in their increasing availability and scale, their
 changing role as midstream service providers, and the organizational form
 as farmer cooperatives.
 We discuss each in turn.

 a multi-donor entity devoted to private sector agribusiness development,
 to assist in the procurement of 100 milk coolers, 92 generators, 92 sets
 of milk testing equipment, 1,500 stainless steel milk storage cans, and
 10 insulated milk tankers.
\end_layout

 In the central milk shed, there are, according to data obtained from district
 officials, about 60 milk collection centers.
 In the southwestern milk shed, there seem to be many more milk collection
 centers: in Kiruhura district alone, there are more than 160 centers, often
 with more than one cooler tank.
 The higher density of milk collection centers in the southwestern shed
 is also reflected in the farm level survey data.
 In the central milk shed, average distance to a milk collection center
 is 10 km, while this is only 5.4 km in the southwest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the data we collected from a sample of milk collection centers, we
 can get a better idea of the evolution of milk collection centers over
 time.
 In particular, we asked when the milk collection centers were established.
 This can then be used to graph, separately for the southwestern and central
 milk shed, the share of milk collection centers that were established in
 each year over the last decade (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Evolution-of-milk"

\end_inset

).
 The figure suggests an acceleration in the establishment of new milk collection
 centers in the southwestern milk shed between 2011 and 2015, which coincides
 with the influx of FDI in the area.
 It also shows that in the last two years, the central milk shed has also
 started to establish new collection points.

The proliferation of milk collection centers does not only manifest itself
 at the extensive margin.
 Existing milk collection centers have also been expanding their capacity
 over time.
 We find that, on average, an extra capacity of about 750 liters per year
 was added over the last 10 years.
 However, there is no significant difference in the rate of capacity expansion
 between milk sheds.

Milk collection centers do more than just bulking and cooling the milk for
 further transport.
 They also appear to be important in mid-stream service provision.
 Figure

 shows, for a range of services, what percentage of milk collection centers
 report providing this service, separately for each milk shed.
 For instance, we find that in the southwestern milk shed, more than 70
 percent of milk collection centers say that they provide advances to their
 clients, and this is only slightly lower in the central milk shed.
 About half of the milk collection centers provide training on milk hygiene.
 Interestingly, in the southwestern milk shed, milk collection centers go
 further than only provision of training.
 Here, about 45 percent of centers also provide aluminum milk cans to their
 clients.
 This percentage is significantly lower in the central milk shed (p-value=0.044).
 We also see that in the southwest, more milk collection centers supply
 veterinary medicines and vaccinations, which, as we will see below, is
 particularly important for cross-bred cows.
 However, apart from the supply of aluminium milk cans, none of these difference
s is statistically significant.

Not only do we see an evolution in the number of milk collection centers
 and the services they provide, we also find that more of these collection
 centers are organized as cooperatives.
 This may be partly explained by the fact that quality becomes more important
 in value chains: As many individual small producers supply a milk collection
 center, traceability becomes difficult and milk collection centers have
 to rely on the collective reputation of the product they supply.

 resource in which asymmetric information about the quality that is delivered
 leads to over-extraction from the stock of reputation.

It should be noted, however, that cooperatives often struggle with governance
 issues, which may affect its effectiveness.

 do not find a significant effect of cooperative membership on milk hygiene,
 and a negative impact on milk quality.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, cooperatives may also emerge as a response to issues related
 to excess demand for milk.
 Processors running below capacity compete for milk supplies.
 By offering services (such as training) or inputs (such as milk cans) to
 value chain actors upstream, processors try to increase the productivity
 of farmers, the quality of the milk they market, and enhance their loyalty
 as suppliers.
 However, with fierce competition between processors, dairy farmers also
 have more opportunities for side-selling and less incentives to maintain
 quality.
 In the context of a vibrant local market for milk with few standards or
 quality requirements, these problems are even more pronounced and processors
 will be reluctant to engage in mid-stream service delivery if they are
 unlikely to benefit from it 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "swinnen2015quality"

 Cooperatives may be more appropriate vehicles to foster this loyalty and
 supply some of the services necessary to increase productivity and quality.
 This is consistent with the findings in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 that cooperatives are strong in facilitating technological transformations
 and commercialization, but do not offer better prices.

\begin_layout Standard
Figure

 shows that in the export oriented milk shed, proportionally more producers
 report that they are a member of a cooperative milk collection center (p-value<
0.001).
 This is not because, for some reason, cooperatives in general are more
 common in the southwest: about 20 percent of farmers report that they are
 (also) a member of non-dairy cooperatives, such as a village savings and
 loans association (VSLA), and this proportion is not different between
 the two areas (p-value = 0.374).
 At the trader level, we find that the share of traders that reports to
 be a member of a cooperative milk collection center is actually higher
 in the central milk shed, but the difference is not significant (p-value
 = 0.500).
 Finally, at the level of the milk collection centers, we see that cooperatives
 are more prevalent in the southwest (p-value = 0.053).

Adoption of improved breeds
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An important technological innovation in dairy farming in Uganda is the
 introduction of
\series bold
 
\series default
improved breeds, mostly of the Fresian type.
 The adoption of higher yielding cows is necessary to increase the supply
 of milk.
 In our sample, a cross-bred cow produces on average 5.7 liters of milk per
 day, while a local cow only produces about 3 liters.
 In addition, cross-bred cows are longer in milk than local cows.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Herd-size-and"

\end_inset

 compares herd size and composition as reported by farmers in our sample
 now and 10 years ago, for the central milk shed in the left panel and for
 the southwestern milk shed in the right panel.
 We see that over time, herd size increased from on average 26 cows to 31
 cows in the central milk shed and from 31 to 34 in the central milk shed.
 In the southwestern milk shed, almost 87 percent of animals are of an improved
 breed.
 The central milk shed is catching up with the southwestern milk shed in
 terms of adoption of crossbred cows: while 10 years ago, only 2 out of
 26 cows were improved, this has now become almost 14 out of 31.

Value chain financing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have already indicated above that milk collection centers provide advances
 to their clients.
 Such advances are often used for consumption expenditures.
 However, we also included questions in our survey that particularity look
 at credit obtained in the last year to invest in dairy related activities.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:VCfinancing"

\end_inset

 reports on value chain financing for both producers (top panel) and traders
 (bottom panel).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The table shows that among dairy farmers in the central milk shed, about
 10 percent reported to have taken a loan in the previous year and invested
 this money into dairy farming.
 This percentage is double in the southwestern milk shed.
 We also find that the average amount borrowed was much higher in the southweste
rn milk shed.
 We also show where loans are typically obtained from.
 Village Savings and Loans Associations (VSLAs) are important sources for
 credit in both milk sheds.
 More interestingly, in the central milk shed, farmers also rely to a large
 extent on friends and family for credit.
 In the southwestern milk shed, banks are relatively more involved in financing
 producers.
 Cooperatives are also more likely to provide loans to dairy farmers in
 the southwest than in the central shed.
 The farmers used the money to get treatment for their animals (44 percent)
 or to buy improved cows (34 percent).
 Less than 5 percent of farmers report that they used it for artificial
 insemination.

\begin_layout Standard
From the bottom panel of Table

\end_inset

, we find that traders are more likely to take out loans in the central
 milk shed than in the southwestern milk shed.
 However, the average amount borrowed by traders is still larger in the
 southwestern milk shed.
 Also interesting to see is that both dairy cooperatives and VSLAs seem
 to be more important as a source of loans for traders in the central milk
 shed than in the export-led dairy value chain.
 Family and friends are important in the central shed, and in the southwest,
 banks are important sources of midstream credit.
 Most traders use the credit as working capital to buy more milk from farmers
 or provide upfront payments (about 30 percent).
 About 27 percent of traders indicate that they used the money to buy a
 motorbike.
 There are many traders that indicate that they used the money to buy cows.
 This may mean that traders are also dairy farmers themselves or that they
 want to become dairy farmers in the future.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Feeding and water
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Institutional-environment"

\end_inset

, it was noted that the intensification process, whereby local breeds are
 replaced by cows that produce more milk, is partly driven by privatization
 of pastures.
 As mentioned above, the average farmer has about 45 acres of land that
 he or she can use for grazing the animals, and there is no difference between
 the two sheds.
 However, in the southwest, about 93 percent of farmers report that (at
 least part of) this land is fenced.
 In the central region, this is only 64 percent.
 Consistent with this, 80 percent of farmers in the central milk shed report
 that they rely on free range for grazing the animals, while in some cases
 the cows are tethered.
 In the southwest, on the contrary, almost half of the farmers report that
 they use paddocking, a much more controlled way of rotational grazing.
 Supplemental feeding was virtually non-existent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A more sedentary livestock production system in the southwest also affects
 water provision on the farm.
 In the central region, 12 percent of farmers relies on dams as a source
 of water for the animals.
 In the southwest, almost 70 percent of farmers report that they rely on
 dams that they constructed on their land.
 This also results in differential access to water.
 In the southwest, 71 percent of farmers report they either have no problems
 or only occasional problems in sourcing sufficient amounts of water.
 This is ten percentage points lower in the central milk shed.
 In the central milk shed, 12 percent of farmers report that they always
 have trouble getting sufficient water for their dairy activities, while
 this is only 8 percent in the southwest.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Milk handling and sanitation
\begin_inset CommandInset label

name "subsec:Milk-handling-and"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another set of important innovations is related to milk handling and sanitation.
 The use of stainless steel or aluminum buckets and milk cans is very important
 to safeguard the quality of the milk.
 However, farmers often use plastic buckets during milking.
 More problematic is the use of plastic jerry cans by transporters and traders.
 Plastic jerry cans are difficult to clean and the surface is easily scratched.
 This increases the likelihood of microbial contamination.
 Jerry cans easily heat up in the sun, accelerating bacterial growth.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Use-of-milk"

\end_inset

 shows that, throughout the dairy value chain, custom aluminum milk containers
 are becoming the norm in the export-led milk shed.
 The central milk shed is still far behind, especially upstream.
 For instance, while we find that almost 65 percent of farmers in the southwest
 use stainless steel or aluminum buckets or containers to collect and store
 the milk, this is only 20 percent in the central milk shed.
 Here the majority of farmers report they are using plastic buckets or plastic
 jars.
 We also find that farmers typically have at least one stainless steel or
 aluminum bucket and one stainless steel or aluminum milk can in the southwest.
 In the central milk shed, almost no farmer has a milk can.

\begin_layout Standard
About 60 percent of the traders that were interviewed in the southwest reported
 that they only use proper milk cans for their business.
 This was only 10 percent in the central region.
 A trader in the southwest has on average 4.4 milk cans.
 Most of these are 25 liter cans.
 The differences between the milk sheds are smaller at the level of the
 milk collection centers.
 In the central milk shed, 62 percent of milk collection centers reported
 to be using only stainless steel or aluminum containers.
 In the southwest this is 84 percent.
 Milk collection centers in the southwest have on average 35 milk cans.
 This is consistent with the fact that in the southwest, milk collection
 centers assist their clients with milk cans (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Services-provided-by"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Milk sanitation is not only determined by the type of containers in which
 it is stored and transported.
 Another key determinant of milk quality is the time between milking and
 chilling.
 Milk that reaches the milk collection center too late generally does not
 pass the alcohol test.
 In this context, the adoption of light Indian or Chinese made motorbikes
 by traders is also a relevant innovation within the dairy value chain.
 We find that while about 72 percent of traders use a motorcycle in the
 central milk shed, this percentage increases to 84 in the southwestern
 milk shed, and this difference is significant (p=0.003).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Econometric analysis – Integration into modern dairy value chains
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The previous section explored innovations within the dairy value chain by
 comparing the predominantly export oriented southwestern milk shed to the
 central milk shed that supplies the local market.
 In this section, we focus on integration into modern dairy value chains
 more generally.
 To do so, we define indicators of integration into modern value chains
 that cut across geographic location.
 Indeed, it may be that in the central milk shed, some actors are also integrate
d in modern value chains in which part of the production is exported.
 For instance, many farmers from the central region supply milk collection
 centers that ship to Brookside in Kampala, which exports substantial parts
 to Kenya.
 Also, Jesa Dairy Ltd in Wakiso procures most of its milk from the central
 shed.
 According to DDA statistics, Jesa also exports considerable amounts of
 milk.
 At the same time, not all actors located in the southwest produce for the
 export market.
 Also here, there is a sizable local market.
 Simply comparing actors in the southwest to actors in the central region
 may thus not accurately capture differences between modern value chains
 involving complex products that are able to compete in export markets and
 value chains geared towards local consumption of less processed commodities.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The indicator of integration in modern value chains includes export-led
 value chains, but also comprises the local value chains that supply pasteurized
 milk to the local market.
 For farmers, we create an indicator of integration within the modern dairy
 value chains that is true if the farmer delivered milk to a milk collection
 center every day during the week before the survey.
 This enables us to differentiate between commercially oriented farmers
 that produce for the market on a daily basis and farmers that mainly produce
 for own consumption but may sporadically sell when they have a surplus.
 Deliveries to milk collection centers can be made directly, or indirectly
 through a trader or a transporter
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We asked farmers different questions depending on where the trader or transporte
r would take the milk.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Using this definition, we find that half of the farmers in our sample are
 integrated into modern value chains.
 As expected, there is a significant overlap of this indicator with the
 milk sheds: in the central region, only about 40 percent is part of a modern
 value chain.
 In the southwest, this is almost three quarters of the farmers that were
 interviewed.
 For the trader or transporter, we create an indicator of integration within
 modern dairy value chains that is true if the trader or transporter reports
 delivering exclusively to a milk collection center or directly to a processor.
 More in particular, we first ask how much milk was collected from farmers
 on an average day during last dry season.
 We then probed for the share of milk that was delivered to different outlets
 on an average day during the last dry season.
 Farmers that supply 100 percent of collected milk to milk collection centers
 or processors were defined as being integrated into modern dairy value
 chains.
 According to this definition, about 43 percent of traders are integrated
 into modern value chains.
 As for traders, there is also a difference between the sheds, with about
 38 percent of farmers integrated in modern chains in the central region,
 while this is 62 percent in the southwestern region.
 Finally, for milk collection centers, the indicator is based on whether
 they report to be delivering to processors or not.
 Here differences between milk sheds are smaller: according to this definition,
 78 percent of milk collection centers located in the central milk shed
 are integrated into modern value chains, while this goes up to 81 percent
 in the southwestern milk shed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Farmers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start with the analysis of the farmer level data and compare a range
 of innovations between farmers that are part of modern value chains to
 those that operate in a more traditional context.
 We present results for three different models: simple differences-in-means,
 conditional means that also control for a range of observables, and difference-
in-means after making both groups more comparable using propensity score
 matching 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Results are in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Innovations-in-export"

\end_inset

.
 The different innovations are indicated in the left column.
 For instance, we look at mid-stream service delivery (such as the provision
 of training, inputs and credit), adoption of improved animals, adoption
 of improved pasture management (paddocking) and innovations in the sphere
 of milk sanitation.
 In the first column (1) of the table, means for each innovation in the
 subgroup of farmers that are not integrated in modern value chains (the
 control group) are reported for reference.
 The second column (2) shows a simple differences between the average among
 farmers that are integrated in modern value chains and the control group
 for each of the innovation indicated in the left column.
 The third column (3) in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Innovations-in-export"

\end_inset

 shows for each innovation the difference between the subset of farmers
 that are part of a modern value chain and the control group, but now estimated
 in a regression framework, where we control for a range of farmer and context
 characteristics.
 In particular, we add controls for the age of the household head, sex of
 the household head, household size, whether the household head has attended
 at least secondary school, the distance of the farm to the nearest neighbour,
 distance to a shop where veterinary supplies can be bought, access to credit,
 and the size of land that can be used for grazing the animals.
 We also include a set of dummy variables that indicate the district the
 farm is located in
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that this implicitly means we also control for milk shed, as 2 districts
 form the southwestern milk shed and the other four districts belong to
 the central milk shed.

Finally, in the last column (4) of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Innovations-in-export"

\end_inset

 we present results for the difference in average adoption rates between
 the two groups after making both groups more comparable using propensity
 score matching.
 To estimate the propensity score, we use the same variables as the ones
 we used in the regression models.
 We use nearest neigbour matching with a caliper of 0.05
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This means that only comparison units within a certain width of the propensity
 score of the treated units get matched, the distance threshold being .05
 standard deviations of the propensity score.
 While this reduces the number of observations that can be matched, it greatly
 increases balance.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Doing so, we were able to match 373 farmers that participate in modern
 value chains to 373 traditional farmers.
 Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Balance-on-covariates"

\end_inset

 shows that this procedure considerably improves balance between the sample
 of farmers that is integrated in modern value chains and those that are
 not.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Milk-handling-and"

\end_inset

, an important innovation in the dairy value chains is mid-stream service
 delivery by milk collection centers.
 More in particular, Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Services-provided-by"

\end_inset

 shows the various services that milk collection centers report they provide
 to their clients.
 Here, we look at services received from the person or organization they
 sell to, as reported by the farmers.
 The first row is general and asks if any service is provided by the buyer.
 We find that, about 14 percent of farmers in local value chains report
 that they have received some kind of assistance from the buyer (column
 1).
 This is almost 5 percentage points higher among farmers that are integrated
 in modern value chains (column 2).
 If we control for a range of other observable characteristics, the difference
 is almost 6 percentage points (column 3).
 Full results for the regression in Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Regressions-for-farmer"

\end_inset

 also show that the likelihood that farmers receive assistance is higher
 among better educated farmers and farmers that have access to credit.
 Interestingly, larger farms appear less likely to receive assistance.
 Finally, column 4 in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Innovations-in-export"

\end_inset

 reveals that the difference becomes insignificant after matching.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following three rows (training/advice, inputs, and advances) look at
 services provided by buyers in greater detail.
 We find that very few farmers receive training from downstream value chain
 actors, and that this is only slightly higher in modern value chains.
 Input provision by the buyer is more common.
 Surprisingly, input provision seems more common in traditional value chains.
 Finally, about 3 percent of farmers mention that they received advances
 from actors down the value chain in traditional value chains.
 This percentage increases to 12 in modern value chains if we consider the
 simple difference (column 2).
 If we consider the matching model as the preferred model, the difference
 is only about 6 percentage point, but still significant at the 1 percent
 level.
 Full regressions in Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Regressions-for-farmer"

\end_inset

 shows consistent positive correlations between education level and assistance
 received from downstream actors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An important institutional innovation was the cooperative.
 Therefore, we compare levels of cooperative membership among farmers between
 traditional and modern dairy value chains.
 We find that in the control group, about 8 percent of farmers report to
 be a member of a dairy cooperative.
 Judged by a simple difference in means, we find this proportion to be more
 than double in modern value chains.
 However, the difference becomes insignificant once we include controls
 or match on observables.
 Most likely, the observed difference in column 2 is explained by the fact
 that dairy cooperatives are much more prevalent in the southwestern milk
 shed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The adoption of improved cows is another important innovation at the producer
 level.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Innovations-in-export"

\end_inset

 shows that in the control group of farmers that are integrated in traditional
 dairy value chains, about 40 percent of cows are of an improved type (column
 1, row 6).
 Adoption of improved cows increases by almost 27 percentage points among
 farmers that are integrated in modern value chains.
 Accounting for a range of other observables, either in a regression or
 through matching, reduces this difference.
 However, it remains substantial and significant at the 1 percent level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Value chain financing was also highlighted in the previous section.
 We asked if farmers obtained a loan in the previous year that was invested
 in the dairy business.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Innovations-in-export"

\end_inset

 shows few farmers in the control group reported that they took a loan (8
 percent).
 Simple differences reveal that this is almost 15 percent in the group of
 farmers that are integrated in modern value chains.
 After correcting for household and contextual characteristics, the difference
 reduces and eventually becomes statistically indistinguishable from zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next two rows present results for innovations in feeding practices.
 In particular, we look at improved pasture management and the construction
 of dams for access to water.
 We find that 14 percent uses rotational grazing through paddocking in the
 control group and that this is higher among farmers that are in modern
 value chains.
 But again, the difference disappears entirely if controls are added in
 a regression or through matching.
 Again, this is probably because paddocking is especially prevalent in the
 southwest; farmers here seem to engage in paddocking even if they are supplying
 the local market.
 About 45 percent of farmers in the control group reports they use a dam
 as a source of water for the animals.
 Here, we find that this percentage is significantly higher among farmers
 that are in modern value chains, and the difference remains stable and
 significant across specifications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, the introduction of aluminum buckets and cans to increase the quality
 of milk is also an important innovation.
 We find that only 14 percent of farmers in the traditional dairy sector
 use proper equipment for milking.
 We register a large increase in this proportion among farmers that are
 integrated into modern value chains.
 The difference remains significant even after accounting for other factors
 such as the milk shed or scale of the farm.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Traders
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Innovations-traders"

\end_inset

 shows results for a similar analysis using the trader data.
 Also here, we show averages in the sub-sample of traders that are integrated
 in traditional value chains (column 1) and differences with those that
 are integrated in modern value chains (column 2).
 We then add conditioning variables in column 3.
 Full results for these regressions can be found in the appendix (Table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Regressions-for-trader"

\end_inset

).
 We control for the age of the trader, whether he or she has finished secondary
 education, whether he or she is the head of a household, the sex of the
 trader and the household size of the household the trader belongs to.
 We also control for years of experience as a dairy trader and whether the
 trader reports to have access to finance.
 We also include dummies for the district the trader operates in.
 In column 4 we show differences between traders in the two types of value
 chains after matching (Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Balance-traders"

\end_inset

 reports balance before and after matching).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start by looking if there is a difference between cooperative ownership
 between traders that are operating within modern value chains versus those
 that are working in traditional chains.
 We see that cooperative membership is fairly high among traders: 41 percent
 of traders respond that they are a member of a cooperative.
 We do not find that cooperative membership differs between the two types
 of value chains, which is consistent with the fact that we also find little
 difference in cooperative membership of traders between the two milk sheds
 we study.

We also found above that traders in the central milk shed are more likely
 to take a loan to invest in their business, even though the amounts are
 smaller than the average amount borrowed in the southwestern milk shed.
 Using integration into modern value chains as a conditioning variable,
 we now find that about 20 percent of traders that are working in the traditiona
l milk sub-sector have borrowed to invest in their business, and there is
 no significant difference between traders in the traditional and modern
 sub-sector.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last two rows in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Innovations-traders"

\end_inset

 look at innovations in quality preservation of milk.
 We see that about 20 percent of traders in local dairy value chains use
 only aluminum cans for transporting milk.
 While we found a sizable difference in these proportions between the two
 milk sheds, this difference disappears when we compare modern and traditional
 value chains.
 This seems to suggest that enforcement of policies and regulations by the
 DDA, and in particular the ban on transporting milk in inappropriate containers
, is particularly enforced in the southwest.
 About 74 percent of these traders use a motorbike, reducing the time between
 milking and chilling.
 Also here, while the difference was significant if we compared milk sheds,
 there is no difference if we define integration in modern milk sheds as
 delivering exclusively to a milk collection center or processor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

Finally, we also look at innovations using the data that was collected on
 milk collection centers.
 Results are presented in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

.
 As in previous tables, the first column shows averages for milk collection
 centers that do not deliver to processors.
 Note that we only have 19 such milk collection centers.
 The second column reports differences between milk collection centers that
 deliver to processors and those that do not.
 In the third column, we augment the models with additional controls.
 In particular, we control for the number of years the center has been operating
, its capacity in liters, whether the milk collection center is a sub-center
 of a larger one, as well as a dummy for the southwestern milk shed.
 Column 3 in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 center being part of a value chain linking producers to processors; full

For the milk collection centers, we start by looking if there is a difference
 in organizational structure depending on whether the milk collection center
 supplies the traditional market or the modern market.
 We find that about 36 percent of the milk collection centers that supply
 the local market are cooperatives.
 This proportion seems to be slightly higher in value chains where collection
 centers supply processors, but the difference is not statistically significant.

, we confirm that cooperative membership is significantly higher in the
 southwestern milk shed.
 The table also shows that a collection center is less likely to be a cooperativ
e if it is a sub center.
 This consistent with some processors maintaining their own collection centers.

 concern services that milk collection centers report that they provide,

.
 For all but one of the services, we find that it does not matter whether
 the milk collection center supplies to the local market or to processors.
 In fact, we find that milk collection centers that produce for local markets
 claim they are more likely to provide veterinary services.
 Full results in Appendix Table

 show that, consistent with Figure

\end_inset

, milk collection centers in the southwestern milk shed report that they
 are more likely to provide milk cans to their suppliers.
 Finally, the higher use of milk cans by milk collection centers also seems
 to be the same irrespective of whether the milk collection center is integrated
 in the modern sector or not.
 The difference found in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 thus seems again due to the milk shed (see Appendix Table

Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a result of increased demand for dairy products, both locally and from
 abroad, and facilitated by privatization and liberalization, the dairy
 sub-sector in Uganda has transformed substantially.
 Using data collected from three key value chain actors–farmers, traders
 and milk collection centers–we explored patterns in key innovations that
 are both a cause and consequence of transforming value chains.
 We did this by first highlighting some of the differences and similarities
 between the central milk shed and the southwestern milk shed.
 The southwestern milk shed has received substantial FDI in recent years,
 mainly in the form of processing capacity for the export market, while
 the central milk shed is quickly become the most important source of dairy
 products for the local market.
 In a second part of the paper, we constructed an indicator that captures
 integration in modern value chains more generally across the two milk sheds,
 and compared characteristics of actors that are part of more traditional
 dairy supply chains.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We found that the proliferation of milk collection centers was an important
 innovation mid-stream.
 Milk collection centers collect and bulk milk from numerous small farmers,
 sometimes directly, but mostly through small milk traders.
 They form the start of the cold chain and are central to quality control
 and preservation.
 However, we found that milk collection centers also provide a range of
 services to their suppliers.
 In doing so, these centers enabled and supported a range of other innovations
 throughout the value chain.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By changing the incentives small dairy farmers face as well as providing
 them with support services, the rise of modern value chain actors in the
 midstream of the value chain appeared to enable smallholder farmers to
 upgrade their practices and increase their productivity as well.
 We found that farmers that were more integrated into export-led and modern
 dairy value chains reported higher adoption rates of cross-bred cows.
 Adoption of higher yielding animals is important to meet the demand from
 the sector.
 However, many farmers do not invest in improved animals because of their
 higher susceptibility to pests and diseases

Other reasons included intensive management requirements, no feeding industry,
 and lacking or poor quality artificial insemination services.

.
 East Coast fever in particular, a tick-borne disease caused by the protozoan
 parasite, 
\emph on
Theileria Parva
\emph default
, was reported to be killing many animals.
 Milk collection centers, to some extent, support farmer by providing them
 with acaricides and sometimes even veterinary services.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We found evidence of increased attention to quality and milk sanitation,
 especially in export-led value chains.
 This was especially the case at the farmer level, where the use of milk
 cans quickly becomes the norm.
 Even though not statistically supported (potentially due to smaller sample
 size), changes also seem to happen at the level of the trader and milk
 collection center.
 However, up to now, this seemed to be especially through enforcement of
 a ban on transporting milk in jerry cans by the DDA.
 Currently, the Authority focuses on policing the southwestern milk shed,
 but this may become too costly at a larger scale.
 In addition, milk quality involves much more than just using proper milk
 cans.
 An additional way to increase milk sanitation would be to incentivize quality
 through a premium on the price.
 According to our data, price premia for quality do not exist in Uganda,
 possibly because milk collection centers do not have the tools and the
 capacity to accurately determine quality.
 We found that milk collection centers support quality preservation within
 the dairy value chain through the provision of milk cans and by providing
 training to their suppliers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In export-led value chains, we also documented a shift in value chain financing
 from friends and family towards more formal financing through financial
 institutions.
 However, most of the financing seemed to go to preserving the animal stock
 (farmer level - buying medicine and paying for veterinary services) and
 to increasing working capital (trader level), as opposed to investment.
 Longer run credit with better interest rates are needed for further upgrading
 of the value chain.
 Milk collection centers seem to provide credit to their suppliers, and
 traders also use most of the credit they get to pay advances to farmers
 to secure more milk.
 However, such advances are most likely used by farmers to finance immediate
 consumption needs.
 Credit is perhaps better supplied by a third party to avoid situations
 where farmers work themselves into debt and are then locked into a situation
 where milk collection centers or traders force farmers to supply milk at
 low prices.

[Bart]Can also happen with third party?[Bjorn] Less likely, I think.
 A third party will just want to make money, but has no interest in getting
 low prices.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we also found signs that rotational grazing is taking off in modern
 value chains, and that farmers in such value chains constructed dams to
 get a stable water supply.
 However, this is only a start.
 To come to substantial productivity gains, the water will also need to
 be distributed within the farms to avoid cows from having to walk long
 distances.
 The use of additional feeding practices, such as hay making and silage,
 is not very common.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While we highlighted some key innovations and pointed out the importance
 of milk collection centers in mid-stream service provision, we also think
 the sector stands to gain from further development of the dairy service
 sector.
 Services provided by milk collection centers related to animal health,
 generally limited to the supply of acaricides, seem insufficient at present.
 Ticks become quickly resistant to the acaricides, and some farmers are
 switching back to local breeds because they are less prone to tick fever.
 Clearly, milk collection centers do not have the capacity to carry out
 research on resistance to acaricides.
 More generally, many services would benefit from the development of a specializ
ed dairy service sector supporting milk producers.
 For instance, (cross-bred) cows produce much less than what would be possible
 because of the absence of a modern feed sector.
 Our data also suggests that artificial insemination is almost non-existent.
 But the lack of a supporting service sector also constrains the further
 development of the sector at higher levels.
 For example, processors complain that a lacking industrial base in Uganda
 means that they have to import all packaging material, reducing margins
 and making their products less competitive on the international market.
 While we found that milk collection centers engage in service provision
 to some extent, more will be needed for further upgrading of the value
 chain.
