Domestic versus export-led agricultural transformation: Evidence from Ugandaâ€™s
 dairy value chain 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Driven by increased demand from both local and export markets and facilitated
 by far-reaching liberalization and privatization policies, the dairy sub-sector
 in Uganda has undergone significant changes in the last few decades.
 With a comparative advantage in milk production, the southwest of Uganda
 has started to attract considerable Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in
 processing capacity, mainly targeting the export market.
 At the same time, other milk producing areas such as the central region
 have stepped in to cater for the local market, particularly urban consumers
 in Kampala and other secondary towns.
 We exploit this evolution of the value chain at two speeds to document
 trends in key technological and institutional innovations that both result
 from the emergence of export-led dairy value chains and drive further upgrading.
 Furthermore, as most processors are to some extent involved in export,
 we also correlate these innovations to the level of integration into formal
 value chains as a robustness check.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dairy value chain in Uganda has undergone substantial changes in the
 last few decades.
 These changes were driven by a variety of factors.
 On the demand side, consumption of milk has been on the rise.
 As regional poverty has decreased dramatically, higher incomes resulted
 in rapidly increasing consumption of dairy products, which are known to
 be highly income elastic 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "COLEN2018116,10.1093/jn/133.11.3907S"

\end_inset

.
 Especially in cities, consumers are confronted with an increasing availability
 of various dairy products such as milk, yogurt and ice cream in both informal
 shops and emerging supermarkets, and consumers become increasingly aware
 of the health benefits of dairy products 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ruel2017urbanization,francesconi2010evolution"

\end_inset

.
 But not only local demand for dairy products has increased.
 The dairy sub-sector has also become an important export sector for Uganda.
 On the supply side, the government's liberalization push in the late nineties
 and the eventual privatization of the state parastatal led to a gradual
 increase in competition between processors.
 But the most important supply push is probably the influx of Foreign Direct
 Investment (FDI) in processing capacity geared towards the export market
 from 2014 onward.
 These demand and supply drivers led to a significant transformation of
 the dairy value chain.
 In this paper, we document some of the endogenous innovations that simultaneous
ly occurred at different levels within the chain.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Interestingly, due to a combination of agglomeration effects and a comparative
 advantage in milk production, the influx of foreign direct investment concentra
ted almost exclusively in the so-called southwestern milk shed, located
 around the town of Mbarara.
 As a result, this area has become tightly integrated in a global export-led
 value chain: in the course of only a few years, the value chain has changed
 dramatically, with large processors sourcing raw milk from farmers, often
 organized in cooperatives, converting raw milk into complex products with
 a long shelf life, such as Ultra High Temperature (UHT) treated milk, mostly
 for export.
 At the same time, a nearby area similar in agro-ecological conditions and
 with similar aggregate production levels, has taken over milk production
 for the local market.
 This area, referred to as the central milk shed, has become the main supplier
 for dairy products in the capital city, Kampala.
 This bifurcation allows us to explore differences between export market-led
 value chain transformation and domestic market-led dynamics.
 At the same time, even in the central milk shed, some farmers reported
 producing for processors that are also engaged in export.
 We therefore also construct and indicator of integration into export-led
 value chains based on links between producers, traders and consumers to
 triangulate our findings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our study mainly relies on primary data, supplemented with data from secondary
 sources.
 The primary data was collected at different nodes in the value chain and
 is used to first describe the structure of the value chain.
 Upstream, we interviewed cattle farmers that produce milk, most of it for
 the market.
 These farmers generally sell raw milk at the farm gate to traders, the
 second category of actors we collected data from.
 However, in the central milk shed, important amounts of milk are also directly
 sold to neighbours, whereas in the southwest, a significant number of farmers
 also sell directly to milk collection centers, often because they are members
 of the cooperative that runs the center.
 Traders and transporters in turn, ship this unprocessed milk to milk collection
 centers, the third category of actors we interviewed.
 In the southwestern milk shed traders also deliver relatively important
 quantities to milk shops.
 Another important actor in the dairy value chain is the processor, who
 sources milk mostly from milk collection centers.
 However, in the central region, milk collection centers also often double
 as shops where neighbours can come and purchase milk.
 Throughout the value chain, volumes of milk in the southwestern milk shed
 are twice as large as volumes in the central milk shed.
 We collected primary data on 1,600 producers, 700 small traders, and 100
 milk collection centers.
 We also collected qualitative data from two processors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then provide a descriptive analysis of the behaviour of the different
 value chain actors.
 We find significant quantities of milk are marketed.
 In the central milk shed, milk is often sold to neighbours in small quantities.
 Milk fetches relatively high prices on the informal market.
 Farmers sell to traders or use transporters with whom they have an important
 trust relationship.
 Traders visit farmers daily and payments happen weekly or even monthly.
 Farmers that work with one and the same transporter who provides a service
 for a fee seems particularly important in the southwestern milk shed.
 Cooperatives not only seem important for quality control, the often also
 facilitate access to veterinary services.
 All value chain actors struggle with seasonality.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we consider innovations that simultaneously occurred at different
 levels within the chain.
 We find some evidence that technology adoption is correlated with being
 integrated in global value chains.
 In the southwestern milk shed, almost 87 percent of animals are of an improved
 breed.
 The central milk shed, half of the cows are still local varieties.
 We also see correlations with milk sanitation: Throughout the dairy value
 chain, custom milk containers are becoming the norm in the export led milk
 shed.
 There are also innovations in terms of how parts of the chain is organized:
 in the export oriented milk shed, proportionally more producers report
 that they are a member of a dairy cooperative.
 Also at the level of the milk collection centers, we also see that cooperatives
 are more prevalent in the southwest.
 We also provide a more in-depth analysis of these innovations and its relation
 to inclusion in export-led value chains using regression analysis and matching
 estimators.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our study contributes to the literature in various ways.
 First, most existing studies on value chains in developing countries analyze
 either export-chains 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "maertens2009trade,maertens2009horticulture,minten2009global"

\end_inset

 or domestic chains 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "minten2016feeding,JANSSEN2019327"

\end_inset

.
 This makes it difficult to draw conclusions since one often has to compare
 too many different variables.
 Here we have a case where both export and domestic consumption are an important
 outlet for the same commodity and in the same country.
 This allows us to better capture the importance of the type of value chain
 (export-led versus local) for the innovations we consider.
 Second, with almost 700 small traders interviewed, our study provides evidence
 on the behavior of a group of value chain actors that are hard to capture
 and poorly understood 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "sitko2014exploitative"

\end_inset

.
 Third, while there is a substantial gray literature on dairy value chains
 in Uganda, most of these rely on qualitative data and are limited in terms
 of representatives.
 Our study thus provides an important contribution to understanding the
 dairy sub-sector in Uganda.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rest of this article is organized as follows.
 The next section uses secondary data to highlight the drivers behind the
 transformation of diary sub-sctor.
 We point out potential demand side drivers and explain how policy reforms
 created an enabling environment that attracted considerable foreign direct
 investment.
 We then present the primary data that was collected at different nodes
 in the value chain in the central and the southwestern milk shed.
 The data is also combined to visualize how raw milk flows through the value
 chain.
 Next, we provide descriptive statistics on key behaviour of the actors
 in the value chain, separately for the two milk sheds.
 For instance, we look at production and market participation of farmers,
 document trader marketing patterns, describe milk collection center operations,
 and processing capacity and export value.
 We then identify a range of innovations that are observed within the chain
 and document how they differ between export-led value chains and domestic-led
 value chains.
 First, this is done by simply describing differences by milk shed.
 Next, a different indicator of integration in global value chains is used
 and a more formal analysis is presented.
 A final section concludes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Drivers of dairy value chain transformation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dairy sub-sector in Uganda has grown substantially.
 According to the Uganda Dairy Development Authority, annual milk production
 has increased from 1.4 billion litres of milk in 2006 to 2.2 billion litres
 in 2017/2018.
 The expansion of the sub-sector is driven by an increase in demand, both
 from within Uganda as well as from abroad.
 At the same time, pro-market policy reforms encouraged investment in the
 sub-sector.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Demand factors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Local consumption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consumption of dairy products has been increasing over time in Uganda.
 According to Uganda Dairy Development Authority, the per capita consumption
 of milk in Uganda has increased from 25 litres in 1986 to 62 litres in
 2017.
 However, if we use the official nationally representative Uganda National
 Household Surveys (UNHS), average per capita milk consumption seems much
 lower.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Consumption-of-liquid"

\end_inset

 shows yearly per capita liquid milk consumption in liters as estimated
 using four different waves of the UNHS.
 We see that according to this data, as recent as 2001/02, the average Ugandan
 consumed only about 12 liter of milk per person per year.
 At that time, consumption in rural and urban areas was virtually the same,
 underlining the importance of the informal market and autoconsumption of
 milk.
 By 2012/13, average consumption per capita has doubled.
 The figure shows that most of the increase in milk consumption is due to
 an increase in demand in urban areas, reaching 33 liters per capita per
 year in 2012/13.
 In rural areas, milk consumption seems to fluctuate between 10 and 20 liters
 per capita per year.

\begin_layout Standard
The consumption reported in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 captures only liquid milk.
 However, Ugandans also consume dairy products in other forms.
 For instance, in rural areas, 
\emph on
bongo
\emph default
, a type of buttermilk that can be stored longer than liquid milk, is very
 popular
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Often, milk that can not be sold (eg.
 because it fails the alcohol test) is processed into bongo.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, in rural areas, ghee is used in cooking, and in urban areas,
 butter and yogurt consumption is taking off.
 Unfortunately, the UNHS does not explicitly differentiate between different
 dairy products.
 Only ghee consumption is recorded separately, but there is no mention of
\emph on
 bongo
\emph default
, which is likely to be more important as a source of micro-nutrients.
 Primary data collected from about 1,600 milk farmers in the central and
 southwestern milk shed (which will be described in detail later) suggests
 that more than half of the farmers consume bongo on a regular basis and
 the volumes consumed are only slightly lower than milk.
 As a result, the consumption of dairy products is likely to be substantially
 higher than what is reported in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Export-led
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not only national consumption has increased.
 Over time, and especially since 2014 after the establishment of various
 processing plants in the southwestern milk shed and boosted by a depreciating
 local currency, dairy exports have increased exponentially (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Import-and-export"

\end_inset

).
 The latest available data suggests that US$ 130 million worth of dairy
 products have been exported in 2017.
 The DDA reports that almost half of the export value, 55 million, was exported
 by a single processor (Pearl Dairy Farms Ltd).
 This processor exports mostly milk powder to countries on the Arabian peninsula
, but also to Nigeria and even to Japan.
 About 20 percent of the total export value is exported to Kenya through
 Brookside Ltd.
 Birunga Dairies Industries, located in the Southwestern tip of Uganda (and
 outside our study area), exports about 18 million USD worth of milk to
 the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda.
 Amos Dairies Ltd focuses on casein exports to the United states (11 million
 USD).
 Smaller processors such as Lakeside Diaries Ltd.
 specialize in other locations such as South Sudan.

\begin_layout Standard
The success of dairy as an export commodity came as a surprise.
 For instance 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "sheperd"

\end_inset

 is hesitant about the future of the dairy sub-sector in Uganda as a strong
 export oriented sector, pointing out informality of relationships constrained
 the development of contractual interactions, resulting in supply uncertainties
 at the level of the processors.
 Dairy is not considered a priority sector from an export point of view,
 yet it has become the third most important export commodity, after coffee
 (US$ 555 million) and fish (US$ 140 million), and leaves other traditional
 export sectors such as tea (US$ 80 million) and flowers (US$ 60 million)
 trailing behind.
 Uganda's dairy exports are now similar to South Africa and on its way to
 become the largest dairy exporter on the continent in the near future.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Institutional environment
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:Institutional-environment"

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The transformation of the dairy sub-sector in Uganda is also driven by a
 range of policy reforms.
 In the past, the (formal) dairy sector was heavily centralized, and all
 milk needed to pass through the National Dairy Corporation, a parastratal
 dairy processing organization.
 The privatization push of the new government of Museveni that came to power
 in 1986 also impacted the dairy sector.
 One of the first milestones was the passing of the Dairy Industry Act in
 parliament in 1998, which established the Dairy Development Authority (DDA).
 This entity under Uganda's Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industries,
 and Fisheries (MAAIF) was established to create an enabling environment
 for the sector.
 As such, it assumes the dual role of both promoting diary production and
 regulating the industry.
 However, it was only in 2006 that the National Dairy Corporation was privatized
, and even then, the state monopoly was simply replaced by another monopoly:
 the National Dairy Corporation was bought by Sameer Agriculture and Livestock
 Ltd.
 As part of the deal, Sameer also acquired all the milk collection centers,
 coolers and bulking centers that were part of the cold chain.
 This left smallholder milk producers with few options other than selling
 to Sameer at very low prices.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to this, and the realization that much money was left on the table,
 both individual investors as well as cooperatives began to install their
 own coolers and organize milk collection and bulking.
 One noteworthy initiative was taken by the Uganda Crane Creameries Cooperative
 Union (UCCCU), an umbrella organization that brings together dairy cooperatives
 in Uganda.
 The UCCCU approached the Agricultural Business Initiative (aBi) Trust,
 a multi-donor entity devoted to private sector agribusiness development,
 to assist in the procurement of 100 milk coolers, 92 generators, 92 sets
 of milk testing equipment, 1,500 stainless steel milk storage cans, and
 10 insulated milk tankers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some observers say that the sector only really took off with the advent
 of processing companies that, attracted by low prices, produce mostly for
 export.
 For instance, Amos Dairies Limited, a diary processing company, based in
 Punjab, India, set up a processing plant in Kirihura that focuses on the
 extraction of casein in 2014.
 Pearl Dairy Farms Limited opened in 2013 and mostly processed milk into
 powder.
 The success of these processors also attracted a range of smaller processors
 to the area, often in the form of (Indian) foreign direct investment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Today, the sector can be described as fairly competitive.
 The creation of the East African Community means that milk, which can be
 produced relatively cheaply in Uganda, is in high demand in neighboring
 countries, Kenya in particular.
 That said, there are still substantial policy related uncertainties.
 Tanzania, for example, keeps protecting its local dairy market.
 Furthermore, during an extended drought in 2017, Kenya single-handedly
 decided to levy an import tax on milk, temporary suspending the EAC for
 milk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Uganda's privatization push also affected livestock farmers directly.
 Traditionally, livestock farmers in the cattle belt, a semi-arid area that
 stretches from the southwest all the way to the northeast, were nomadic
 pastorals.
 They roamed across communal land, seeking forage and water.
 Especially for the Ankole tribe of southwestern Uganda, livestock is an
 important part of their cultural identity, and prestige is derived from
 the size of the herd.
 The herd was depended upon for subsistence, and only if cash was needed,
 occasionally animals were sold.
 However, due to privatization, communal lands were fenced off, depriving
 nomadic farmers from grazing land and, more importantly, water sources.
 This gradually led to a shift away from livestock ownership as a store
 of wealth, toward a more commercially oriented, sedentary livestock sub-sector,
 where maximization of productivity of cattle became the main objective

\begin_layout Section
Primary Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Structure of the value chain
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Uganda is divided into so-called milk sheds, each with different characteristics
 in terms of agro-ecological conditions, farm typologies and market dynamics.
 The southwestern milk shed around Mbarara and the central milk shed comprising
 of the districts Kyankwanzi, Kiboga and Nakaseke, are the two most important
 milk sheds.
 While the agro-ecological conditions and farmer types are pretty similar
 between the two sheds (both lie in the part of the cattle corridor with
 highest seasonal rainfall), market dynamics are different.
 In the southwestern milk shed, low prices have attracted processors that
 are able to compete in the international market.
 This has pushed the supply market for the local dairy value chain that
 supplies Kampala to the central milk shed.
 This resulted in substantial differences in the organization and functioning
 of the value chain and how these areas are integrated in the wider economy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many actors involved in the dairy value chain.
 Upstream, there are the producers who produce for own consumption, but
 also sell significant amounts of milk.
 Often, these are small producers that reside in remote areas.
 Small traders and transporters collect milk in villages at the farm gate
 daily, and transport this to milk collection centers using bicycles, motorbikes
, or sometimes cars.
 Milk collection centers bulk the milk in coolers for further transport
 to processors or consumer markets.
 There are also a range of actors that provide services related to the value
 chain, such as veterinary services, or sell inputs such as feeding supplements.
 Finally, milk is consumed in different forms and by different consumers,
 ranging from neighbors in the village that consume raw milk to consumers
 in the US that use products based on the casein protein (glue, paint,...).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Data collection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We collected survey data on three value chain actors.
 In total, we collected data on 1,600 milk producers, 700 traders and 100
 milk collection centers.
 We started by selecting 14 subcounties from six districts (Mbarara, Kiruhura,
 Kyankwanzi, Kiboga, Nakaseke and Masindi).
 These subcounties were selected to reflect geographic dispersion of actors
 within the value chain.
 We proceeded with a two stage random sampling strategy, where first villages
 were selected with probability proportional to village size.
 In each selected village, we then consulted village household lists to
 randomly select farmers.
 The number of households selected within each village was again proportional
 to the total number of households residing in the village.
 Milk collection centers we selected through simple random sampling from
 the list of milk collection centers in each subcounty obtained from the
 DDA.
 Finally, traders and transporters were sampled using a systematic sampling
 technique where enumerators interviewed the

\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This sampling technique did not entirely turn out satisfactory, as it is
 likely to lead to over-representation of traders and transporters that
 deliver to milk collection centers, who may be different from traders that
 sell to eg.
 milk shops in town, or directly to consumers.
 This caveat should be kept in mind when interpreting results.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Southwestern milk shed
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A total of 312 producers were sampled in the southwestern milk shed.
 More in particular, we interviewed 80 farmers that are located relatively
 close to Mbarara, the second largest town in Uganda and the center of dairy
 processing for export, as well as 232 farmers in Kiruhura, a large district
 located northeast of Mbarara that is heavily relied upon by the export
 processors in Mbarara.
 In Kiruhura, about 50 farmers were interviewed in two villages in Sanga
 sub-county, which is along the highway that connects Mbarara to Kampala
 in the south of the District.
 Adjacent to the north, we interviewed another 50 farmers that are further
 from the road.
 We further interviewed about 158 farmers that are located in the center
 of the district, in Kenshunga sub-county.
 Finally, we added another 35 farmers from Kazo sub-county in the remote
 northwestern tip of the district.
 We also collected information on 37 milk collection centers distributed
 over the two districts and interviewed 153 traders that operate in the
 area.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Central milk shed
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the central milk shed we interviewed farmers in Kyankwanzi and Kiboga
 districts.
 Both districts are relatively well connected to Kampala through the Hoima-Kampa
la highway.
 Kiboga is the district that is closest to Kampala and some areas have a
 high population density.
 We interviewed 282 farmers in Nsambya, a very large sub-county in the north
 west of Kyankwanzi district, along the banks of the Nsuka-Kabi river.
 In the same district, we interviewed another 57 farmers in Wattuba in the
 southeast and closer to the highway.
 In Koboga, we interviewed farmers in 2 different sub-counties.
 Most of them were located close to the highway, but at varying distance
 to Kampala.
 Furthermore, in the central shed, we also interviewed farmers in Nakaseke
 district.
 As there is no highway that transects this district, it is relatively more
 inaccessible than Kyankwanzi and Kiboga.
 Often, it is more convenient for traders to transport milk to Kampala using
 the Masindi-Kampala highway located to the North East of the district.
 In this district, we interviewed a total of 267 farmers distributed over
 two sub-counties.
 In the central milk shed, we interviewed about 500 traders and also surveyed
 50 milk collection centers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also included Masindi district in our sample.
 Technically, this district does not belong to the central milk shed, but
 to the western milk shed.
 We focus on sub-counties that are just north of the Nsuka-Kabi river (Bwijanga
 and Kimengo; about 300 farmers interviewed), and hence similar in agro-ecology
 to Kyankwanzi and Nakaseke.
 Over time, the western milk shed has been gaining in importance.
 The discovery of oil in the area has attracted a lot of foreign direct
 investment, and the dairy industry is anticipating a surge in demand.
 We thus also included one sub-county more into the interior of the district,
 Miirya, where we interviewed 178 farmers.
 We also included about 30 farmers from the peri-urban area around Masindi
 town.
 In Masindi district, we also interviewed 36 traders and surveyed 5 milk
 collection centers.

 Starting from the quantity sold by the average farmer in each shed, it
 shows how the milk is distributed over the value chain.
 The average farmer in the central milk shed puts about 84 liter of milk
 on the market per week (measured in the week before the survey, which was
 at the onset of the dry season).
 Most of this milk, 40 liters, is sold to traders.
 Farmers also sell a lot of their milk to milk collection centers, either
 directly (18 liters), or by contracting a transporter to take the milk
 from the farm-gate to the milk collection center (15 liters)

As will be explained later, we differentiate between traders, who acquire
 ownership of the milk, and transporters, who provide the services of transporta
tion against a fee.
\end_layout

.
 Finally, about 10 liters is sold directly to neighbours.
 Farmers in the southwestern milk shed sell double of what farmers in the
 central milk shed bring to the market (163 liters of milk per week).
 Also here, small traders that collect milk in the rural areas are very
 important, buying up more than half of all marketed milk (86 liters).
 One quarter of the milk is directly sold to milk collection centers (42
 liters per week).
 The use of transport services is, relative to the central shed, somewhat
 less important in the southwestern milk shed.
 Small quantities of milk are also directly sold to neighbours (6 liters)
 and to milk shops in the village or in nearby trading centers (4 liters).

We next estimate how much of the quantities that traders procure (40 liters
 in the central shed and 86 liters in the southwestern shed) is distributed
 over actors further downstream.
 In the central milk shed, traders almost exclusively ship to milk collection
 centers (35 liters).
 The remaining 5 liters is shared between processors (2 liters), milk shops
 (2 liters), and direct sales to villagers (1 liter).
 Trader behaviour is clearly different in the southwestern milk shed.
 Apart from supplying milk to milk collection centers (56 liters), substantial
 quantities of milk are also delivered to milk shops (18 liters) and directly
 to processors (8 liters).
 Traders selling to villagers also seems not uncommon in the southwest (5
 liters).
 Doing the same for transporters, we find that in both milk sheds, transporters
 deliver most of the milk to milk collection centers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the next step, we estimate how the quantities collected by milk collection
 centers (66 liter in the central shed and 122 liter in the southwestern
 shed) are disposed of.
 In both sheds, most milk goes to processors.
 Interestingly, in the central milk shed, milk collection centers also seem
 to be important to sustain local milk consumption, as 21 percent of the
 milk is sold to villagers (14 liters).
 In the southwestern milk shed, sales by milk collection centers to villagers
 is marginal (3 liters).
 In the southwest, milk collection centers also often sell to large traders
 (21 liters, representing 17 percent of total sales by the milk collection
 center).
 These traders generally take milk to Brookside in Kampala.
 While milk collection centers from the center also sell to traders, this
 is relatively less important (6 liters or about 10 percent of total milk
 sold by the milk collection center).
 Finally, fierce competition for supplies in the southwest means that processors
 will also buy non negligible amounts of milk directly from traders (8 liters).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Descriptives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, we describe some of the activities of the actors that are central
 to the value chain.
 In particular, we look at milk production and market participation of producers.
 We also look at marketing patterns for traders and milk collection centers.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Production and market participation
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is significant variation in milk yields, defined as liters produced
 per day per cow.
 Some of this variation is due to seasonality.
 During the rainy season, cows produce on average 5 liter per day.
 This is only 3.7 in the dry season.
 There is also a significant difference in milk yield between the milk sheds.
 Cows in the central region produce on average 3 liters per day, cows in
 the southwestern milk shed produce 4 liters per day.
 We also asked to each farm household how many cows were in milk during
 the last rainy season (March to May 2018) as well as in the last dry season
 (December 2017 to February 2018).
 Overall, farmers have about 8 animals in milk, which represents 25 % of
 the total herd.
 We do not find that these numbers differ between rainy and dry season.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Together with the average amounts of milk per cow produced, this enables
 us to get an idea of the total amount of milk produced at the household
 level.
 We find that the average household produces about 40 liters of milk per
 day during the wet season and 30 liters per day during the dry season.
 However, the distribution is severely skewed; corresponding medians are
 12 liters and 14 liters.
 Furthermore, there are large differences between the two milk sheds.
 Averaging over both rainy and dry seasons, average production per household
 per days is about 30 liters in the central shed, but almost 55 liter in
 the southwest.
 We also asked farmers to estimate how much milk they used to produce 10
 years ago.
 This was only 35 liter in the southwestern milk shed, and less than 20
 liters in the central milk shed.

 reported milk marketing in the week preceding the survey.
 We saw that producers in the southwest market about 163 liters in that
 week.
 In the central region, only about 84 liters was marketed.
 In line with seasonality in production, there is also significant variation
 in market participation.
 During the rainy season, we find that farmer sell on average about 147
 liters of milk daily per week.
 During the dry season, this is only 91 liter.
 As is the case for production, sales are also heavily skewed to the right,
 and median values of sales per week amounting to 70 liters and 49 liters
 for the respective seasons.

 Compared to other agricultural commodities commonly produced by these farmers,
 such as maize and beans, market participation rates are high 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 We see that the southwestern milk shed is much more commercialized than
 the central milk shed.
 In the rainy season, the modal farmer in the southwest sells three quarters
 of his or her milk.
 Also in the dry season, most of the farmers still sell more than half of
 the milk they produce.
 In the central milk shed, we find that in the rainy season most farmers
 sell between 30 and 50 percent of the milk they produce.
 During the dry season, the modal farmer sells half of what was produced.

Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "tab:Market-participation"

\end_inset

 provides detailed information by market channels used by dairy farmers
 in our sample, again separately for the central milk shed and the southern
 milk shed.
 We see that milk is widely traded locally between neigbours.
 In the central milk shed, 31 percent of the farmer indicate that they have
 sold milk to a neighbour in the last week.
 Interestingly, in the milk shed that is dominated by a dairy export sector,
 sales between neigbours in the village is much less common.
 Here, only 11 percent of the farmers indicate that they sold milk to a
 neighbour in the last 7 days.
 In both milk sheds, selling milk at the farm-gate to a middleman is most
 common.
 In the central milk shed, 40 percent of households report that they sold
 to an itinerant trader, while this was one in two farmers in the southwestern
 milk shed.
 About 11 and 14 percent of farmers also report that they use transporters
 to take the milk to milk collection centers.
 We find that a significant share of farmers report that they sold directly
 to milk collection centers at least once in the last week.
 Direct sales to milk collection centers is especially important in the
 southwestern milk shed, where many MCCs are organized as farmer cooperatives.
 Direct sales to milk shops is negligible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The table also shows, for each trader type, the average number of transactions
 that were reported in the previous week.
 In general, farmers transact each day of the week, and there does not seem
 to be much difference by trader type.
 Normally, cows are milked only once in Uganda.
 This is done in the morning, and milk should arrive at the cooler within
 3 hours, otherwise the milk will not pass the alcohol test.
 Few farmers also milk in the evening.
 If milking was done in the evening, this milk is used for home consumption,
 as milk collection centers generally cease to accept milk after 11 am.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also asked with how many different agents of each trader type transactions
 were made.
 For instance, we find that in the central milk shed, the average farmer
 sold milk to about 3 different neighbours in the week previous to the survey.
 In the southwestern milk shed, this is almost four.
 In the southwestern milk shed, farmers seem to work with a designated trader.
 In the central shed, the average number of traders used is almost two.
 In the southwest, farmers that directly supply milk collection centers
 also usually ship to one and the same center.
 This is different in the central region, where farmers seem to work with
 more than one milk collection center (exact Wilcoxon Mann Whitney Rank
 Sum Test of difference in average number of MCCs by milk shed is significant
 at p-value=0.002).
 Most likely, this is because, in the southwest, collection centers follow
 prices set by the processors as a function of international prices.
 In the central region, milk collection centers deliver to varying outlets,
 which may lead to higher variance in prices.
 Farmers may attempt to take advantage of this and ship milk to different
 milk collection centers depending on where highest prices are offered.
 This explanation is consistent with the finding that the standard deviation
 of prices offered by milk collection centers in the central region is significa
ntly higher than the standard deviation of prices offered by milk collection
 southwestern region in the central region (two-sided F-test significant
 at p-value=0.003).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The table also reports prices that were received by farmers conditional
 on marketing channel, again separately for the central milk shed and the
 southwestern milk shed.
 In the central milk shed, we find that highest prices are offered by milk
 collection centers.
 We also see that fairly high prices are obtained when milk is sold to neighbour
s.
 This is different from what is generally found for other commodities such
 as for example maize, where sales to neighbours often happen in the from
 of distress sales, where farmers sell at relatively low prices because
 cash is urgently needed 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "10.1093/qje/qjy034,stephens2011incomplete"

\end_inset

.
 Prices reportedly received from traders and transporters are significantly
 lower.
 This suggests that transport and other transaction costs that the trader
 or transporter incurs are passed on to producers.
 In the southwestern milk shed, it seems that, by far, the lowest prices
 are offered by milk collection centers.
 We also note that even in the shed that is dominated by a well functioning
 export industry, sales of milk to neighbours remains a remunerative business.

Finally, the table also reports average quantities that were sold in the
 last transaction for each marketing channel.
 As was to be expected, quantities sold to neighbours are lowest, on average
 only 5 to 7 liters depending on the milk shed.
 Amounts sold to traders and transporters are between 15 and 30 liters on
 average.
 The pattern also suggests that especially larger farmers engage directly
 with milk collection centers.
 For almost all categories, average amounts marketed are higher in the southwest
ern milk shed than in the central milk shed.

Generally, commodity trade in rural villages are settled cash on delivery.
 Even though farmers will often sell to the same trader and trust relationships
 are important 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "fafchamps2001social"

\end_inset

, transactions are often too few and irregular for a more efficient payment
 arrangement.
 This is different for dairy value chains, where farmers deal with the same
 agents on an almost daily basis.
 Indeed, we see that in the majority of cases where farmers sell to milk
 collection centers, either directly or through traders or transporters,
 payment is weekly or monthly.
 Recent research has shown that, in the absence of formal savings and credit
 markets, such infrequent payment also provides a commitment device, enabling
 farmers to save for bulky expenses 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 For sales to neigbours, direct payment is still the most common arrangement.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Trader marketing patterns
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second important group of actors in the dairy value chain, the traders,
 link producers to other actors downstream, such as milk collection centers,
 milk shops or processors.
 Typically, these traders are individuals that collect milk at the farm
 gate in the villages using a bicycle or a light Indian or Chinese made
 motorbike and transport the milk to the next node in the value chain.
 We differentiate between two types of such middlemen.
 First, there are individuals who buy milk at the farm-gate, transport the
 milk and sell it to actors downstream.
 A key characteristic of these actors is that they assume ownership of the
 milk during transportation.
 This group will be denoted as traders.
 A second group acts as transport service providers.
 They receive a fee to transport the milk of the farmer to its destination,
 such as to the milk collection center.
 Here, ownership of the milk remains with the producer.
 These are called transporters.
 The data shows that almost half of all middlemen we interviewed report
 to be only transporting milk on account of their clients.
 About 30 percent report that they buy milk and sell it further downstream.
 The rest report to be doing both.
 The relatively high percentage of transporters seems to suggest that, in
 the context of daily recurring transactions, sufficient levels of trust
 can be built between the farmer and the middlemen.
 The relatively high level of transporters may also indicate credit constraints
 or an attempt of traders to transfer some of the risk associated with transport
ing milk to the farmer.
 For instance, if milk is rejected at the milk collection center, a transporter
 simply returns the milk to the farmer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Volumes-and-value"

\end_inset

 gives some statistics on volumes and associated values that are handled
 by traders and transporters.
 The top panel gives details on the central milk shed, while the bottom
 panel provides corresponding statistics for the southwestern milk shed.
 We start by looking at how many farmers are visited on an average day by
 a trader and by a transporter.
 Traders seem to visit more clients in a given day than transporters do.
 In the southwest, the traders visit substantially more farmers, up to 12
 on average in the rainy season.
 In terms of liters procured, averages range from 100 liters during the
 dry season in the central milk shed to about 500 liters during the rainy
 season in the southwestern milk shed.
 Note that, although transporters visit fewer producers, they collect about
 the same amounts of milk, suggesting that milk traders who procure and
 sell are particularly important for producers that sell smaller quantities
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "sitko2014exploitative"

\end_inset

.
 Given that the average transport capacity is about 164 liters in the central
 region and almost 200 liter in southwest, this means that in the dry season
 in the central milk shed, transporters make trips with milk cans that are
 only half full, while in the southern milk shed during the rainy season,
 traders make more than 2.5 trips to the milk collection center, milk shop,
 or processor.

The price paid for milk to traders and to transporters is similar.
 More interestingly, during the dry season the price per liter is about
 1,000 UGX, and there seems to be no difference between the central and
 southwestern milk shed.
 During the rainy season, prices decrease dramatically.
 In the central region, prices are about 40 percent lower than in the dry
 season.
 In the southwestern milk shed, prices are only about half of what they
 are in the rainy season.
 This is surprising, as one would expect that the presence of processors
 that process milk into products with longer shelf life would reduce inter-tempo
ral price volatility, particularly in situations where processors produce
 below capacity.

Milk collection centers operations

Another key link in the dairy value chain in Uganda is the milk collection
 center.
 Milk collection centers are structures that have the infrastructure in
 place to bulk and chill the milk as it waits for further transport.
 Generally, milk collection centers form the start of the cold chain.
 Often, these centers are located in rural areas where production of milk
 is high.
 At the same time, it is also important that milk tankers can reach the
 center to further transport the milk down the value chain.
 Most centers power their coolers using generators.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the last decade, many milk collections centers have been established.
 In the central milk shed, there are, according to data obtained from district
 officials, 18 milk collection centers in Kyankwanzi, 19 in Kiboga and about
 20 in Nakaseke.
 In Masindi, there are only 5.
 In the southern milk shed, there seem to be many more milk collection centers:
 in Kiruhura district alone, there are more than 160 cooling centers, often
 with more than one cooler.
 The proliferation of milk collection centers in the southwestern shed is
 also reflect in the farm level survey data.
 In the central milk shed, average distance to a milk collection center
 is 10 km, while this is only 5.4 km in the southwest.
 In the central milk shed, most of these are privately owned (about 70 percent).
 In the southwestern milk shed, half of all milk collection centers are
 cooperatives.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Volumes-and-value"

\end_inset

 shows statistics on volumes handled and prices paid in both rainy and dry
 seasons and by milk shed.
 The average milk collection center has a capacity of about 5,600 liters,
 and there is no difference between the two sheds.
 The table shows that there is considerable under-use of this capacity in
 the dry season, especially in the central milk shed, where tanks are on
 average only 30 percent full.
 Even during the rainy season, the average milk collection center in the
 central milk shed is only filled 60 percent.
 Only in the southwest, there is more milk than milk collection centers
 can handle.
 Here, 75 percent of all milk collection centers we surveyed reported they
 are operating at full capacity during the rainy season.
 This is also clearly reflected in the prices that milk collection centers
 pay for milk.
 Prices during rainy season are 70 percent of what they are in the dry season
 in the central shed while they are only 54 percent of what they are in
 the dry season in the southwestern shed.

Processor capacity and export value
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These days, Uganda has quite a few dairy processing companies.
 According to data obtained from the Dairy Development Authority, there
 are six large scale processors in Uganda with a capacity to process more
 than 100,000 liters per day
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
However, we found substantial differences between capacities reported in
 the DDA data and capacity reported by the processors we interviewed.
 This may indicate that processors are rapidly increasing capacity.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Most of these are located in the Southwestern milk shed.
 GBK Dairy Products Limited is the oldest in Mbarara, with a capacity of
 about 100,000 liters per day.
 Pearl Dairy Farms Limited is the largest.
 Founded in 2013, the plant can currently process up to 800,000 liters of
 milk per day.
 However, during the dry season the factory runs at less than 40 percent
 of its capacity, and even in the rainy season they only reach about 80
 percent.
 The second largest processor in the southwest is Amos Dairies, with, according
 to the DDA information, a capacity of processing 400,000 liters per day.
 Lakeside, founded in 2014, currently only has a capacity of 50,000 liters
 per day but plans to expand to 100,000.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Brookside dairy is also still a large player, but the latest figures we
 could find still put it way behind Pearl in terms of processing capacity
 (560,000 liters per day).
 Located in Kampala, the processor sources milk from different areas.
 According to the data we collected from milk collection centers in the
 central milk shed, about 40 percent of the milk collection centers supply
 processors take their milk to Brookside.
 Jesa is another large processor with processing facilities in Busujju in
 Wakiso district.
 It is currently processing 200,000 liters of milk per day.
 Jesa supplies most of the milk in Kampala in the form of pasteurized milk
 packaged in plastic bags.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many of these processors produce for both the local market and the export
 market, and although there is some specialization, recently the consumer
 market seems to become more competitive with processors that used to only
 produce UHT for export now also producing pasteurized milk for urban markets.
 Pearl Dairy is by far the largest exporter.
 About 90 percent of what they produce is exported.
 In 2017, the company exported worth 55 million USD, about 42 percent of
 total export.
 However, recently, the company has launched its local brand called LATO
 milk, which is quickly becoming popular in Kampala.
 Jesa also exports to Kenya.
 Even smaller players such as Lakeside sell UHT to South Sudan and Kenya.

Descriptive analysis of differences between milk shed

\begin_layout Standard
At the micro level, the extent to which a farmer is integrated in modern
 commercial value chains and his level of technology adoption is determined
 simultaneously.
 Innovating farmers may be more likely to participate in modern value chains
 simply because they are more likely to produce a stable marketable surplus

 Processors in modern value chains may have stringent quality standards
 which only innovating farmers can guarantee 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 At the same time, poorly functioning input and output markets erode the
 profitability of a technology, leading some farmers to opt-out 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Integration into modern value chains may make new technologies profitable
 for various reasons.
 For instance, it may result in a reduction in the risk that no buyer is
 found.
 Buyers may decide to carry some of the transaction cost.
 Processors may decide to offer credit to buy inputs, or even go a step
 further and provide the inputs themselves against future supply.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Adoption of improved breeds
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An important technological innovation in dairy farming in Uganda is the
 introduction of
\series bold
 
\series default
improved breeds, in particular Fresian cows.
 The type of animal also helps explain heterogeneous yields reported in
 section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Production-and-market"

\end_inset

: in our sample, an exotic animal produces on average 5.7 liters of milk
 per day, while a local cow only produces 3 liters.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Herd-size-and"

\end_inset

 compares herd size as reported by farmers in our sample now and 10 years
 ago, for the central milk shed in the left panel and for the southwestern
 milk shed in the right panel.
 We see that over time, herd size increased form on average 26 cows to 31
 cows in the central milk shed and from 31 to 34 in the central milk shed.
 In the southwestern milk shed, almost 87 percent of animals are of an improved
 breed.
 The central milk shed is catching up with the southwestern milk shed in
 terms of adoption of crossbred cows: while 10 years ago, only 2 out of
 26 cows were improved, this has now become almost 14 out of 31.
 The higher average milk yield per cow in the southwest that was reported
 in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Production-and-market"

\end_inset

 should be partly attributed to the higher share of improved cows there.
 In addition to yield differences, the animal type further affects differences
 in production because exotic cows are longer in milk than local cows.
 In our sample, farmers have on average 4.3 crossbreeds in milk and 3.7 local
 cows in milk.

\begin_layout Standard
In section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Institutional-environment"

\end_inset

, it was noted that this intensification process, whereby local breeds are
 replaced by cows that produce more milk, is partly driven by privatization
 of pastures.
 We find that the average farmer in the central region has about 45 acres
 of land that he or she can use for grazing the animals.
 This is slightly lower in the southwest.
 However, in the southwest, only about 93 percent of farmers report that
 (at least part) of this land is fenced.
 In the central region, this is only 64 percent.
 Consistent with this, 80 percent of farmers in the central milk shed report
 that they rely on free range for grazing the animals, while is some cases
 the cows are tethered.
 In the southwest, on the contrary, almost half of the farmers report that
 they use paddocking, a much more controlled way of grazing.
 Supplemental feeding was virtually non-existent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A more sedentary livestock production system in the southwest also affects
 water provision on the farm.
 In the central region, 12 percent of farmers relies on rivers as a source
 of water for the animals.
 In the southwest, almost 70 percent of farmers report that they rely on
 dams that they constructed on their land.
 This also results in differential access to water.
 In the southwest, 71 percent of farmers report they either have no problems
 or only occasional problems in sourcing sufficient amounts of water.
 This is then percentage points lower in the central milk shed.
 In the central milk shed, 12 percent of farmers report that they always
 have trouble getting sufficient water for their dairy activities, while
 this is only 8 percent in the southwest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Various reasons were reported by farmers as to why adoption of improved
 dairy animals was not even more widespread.
 The most important reason why farmers do not invest in improved animals
 is related to the higher susceptibility to pests and diseases
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Other reasons included intensive management requirements, no feeding industry,
 and lacking or poor quality artificial insemination services
\end_layout

.
 East Coast fever in particular, a tick-borne disease caused by the protozoan
 parasite, 
\emph on
Theileria Parva
\emph default
, was reported to be killing many animals.
 Over time, the ticks have become resistant to acaricides.
 Local breeds are much more resistant to these ticks and also have shorter
 hair on the cowskin, making it easier to detect ticks early on.
 East coast fever is such as big problems that some farmers were of the
 opinion that extension should focus on animal survival first before trying
 to increase milk yields.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We thus also collected some information on the extent of the problem and
 what farmers do about it.
 First, we simply asked farmers if ticks are a problem on their farm.
 This was evaluated on a likert scale.
 The majority of farmers, over 60 percent, report that ticks are a huge
 problem, and there seems to be no difference between the two regions.
 Next, we ask if East Coast Fever is a problem on the farm and use the same
 likert scale.
 We find that two thirds of farmers indicate East Coast Fever is a problem
 in the southwestern milk shed, while this is only 45 percent in the central
 milk shed.
 The difference in subjectively assessed severity of East Coast Fever between
 the two sheds is confirmed using a chi square test (p<0.001).
 We also find that more than 95 percent of farmer report to be spraying
 the cows against ticks.
 In the southwest, only 3 out of the 352 farmers reported they did not use
 acaraicides.
 More than 90 percent of households have at least one knapsack sprayer used
 to apply the pesticide to the cowskin.
 Again, this proportion is highest in the southwest.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second important innovations is related to milk handling and sanitation.
 The use of stainless steel or aluminum buckets and milk cans is very important
 to safeguard the quality of the milk.
 However, farmers often use plastic buckets during milking.
 More problematic is the use of plastic jerry cans by transporters and traders.
 Plastic jerry cans are difficult to clean and the surface is easily scratched.
 This increases the likelihood of microbial contamination.
 Jerry cans easily heat up in the sun, accelerating bacterial growth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Use-of-milk"

\end_inset

 shows that, throughout the dairy value chain, custom milk containers are
 becoming the norm in the export led milk shed.
 The central milk shed is still far behind, especially upstream.
 For instance, while we find that almost 65 percent of farmers in the southwest
 use stainless steel or aluminum buckets or containers to collect and store
 the milk, this is only 20 percent in the central milk shed.
 Here the majority of farmers report they are using plastic buckets or plastic
 jars.
 We also find that farmers typically have at least one stainless steel or
 aluminum bucket and one stainless steel or aluminum milk can in the southwest.
 In the central milk shed, almost no farmer has a milk can.
 About 60 percent of the traders that were interviewed in the southwest
 reported that they only use proper milk cans for there business.
 This was only 10 percent in the central region.
 A trader in the southwest has on average 4.4 milk cans.
 Most of these are 25 liter cans.
 The differences are smaller at the milk collection center level.
 In the central milk shed, 62 percent of mccs reported to be using only
 stainless steel or aluminum containers.
 In the southwest this is 84 percent.
 Milk collection centers in the southwest have on average 35 milk cans.
 However, this is because some cooperatives supply cans to farmers and traders
 they work with.

Cooperatives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not only do we see technological innovations within the sub-sector; institutiona
l innovation may also emerge to address particular problems within the value
 chain.
 For instance, as many individual producers supply a milk collection center,
 traceability becomes difficult and milk collection centers have to rely
 on the collective reputation of the product they supply.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "10.1111/j.0002-9092.2005.00712.x"

\end_inset

 point out similarities between collective reputation and a common property
 resource in which asymmetric information about the quality that is delivered
 leads to over-extraction from the stock of reputation.
 A cooperative organization of the milk collection center may be an endogenous
 response to the challenges related to collective reputation and quality
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It should be noted, however, that cooperatives often struggle with governance
 issues, which may affect its effectiveness.
 For instance, in Ethiopia, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "RePEc:trn:csnjrn:v:1:i:1:p:85-103"

\end_inset

 do not find a significant effect of cooperative membership on milk hygiene,
 and a negative impact on milk quality.
\end_layout

.
 Such an explanation is also consistent with the fact that no price premia
 are paid to farmers for quality.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Cooperatives"

\end_inset

 shows that in the export oriented milk shed, proportionally more producers
 report that they are a member of a dairy cooperative (p-value<0.001).
 This is not because, for some reason, cooperatives in general are more
 common in the southwest: about 20 percent of farmers report that they are
 (also) a member of non-diary cooperatives, such as a savings or credit
 organization, and this proportion is not different between the two areas
 (p-value = 0.374).
 At the trader level, we find that the share of traders that reports to
 be a member of a cooperative or union is actually higher in the central
 milk shed, but the difference is not significant (p-value = 0.450).
 However, if we look at where these farmers take their milk, we again see
 that in the export oriented milk shed, a significantly larger share of
 traders report they supply cooperative milk collection centers (p-value
 < 0.001).
 Finally, at the level of the milk collection centers, we also see that
 cooperatives are more prevalent in the southwest (p-value = 0.053).

Cooperatives also provide complementary services to their members.

 For instance, almost 30 percent of cooperative milk collection centers
 report they are supplying medication and provide vaccination services;
 this is only 10 percent for private milk collection centers.
 Similarly, 20 percent of cooperative milk collection centers report they
 have a vet on call, while this is again only 10 percent for private milk
 collection centers.

\begin_layout Standard
Traders and transporters are typically men.
 Also, compared to other actors in the dairy value chain, they are very
 young; on average 30 years old.
 Trading or transporting is indeed typically an activity for young men who
 are often forced to look for off-farm activities due to high population
 growth rates in Uganda.
 Most traders and transporters are independent and work for their own account,
 although in the southwestern milk shed there is also a sizable proportion
 of traders that work for a cooperative milk collection center (14 percent).
 Middlemen are generally recent to the business.
 Traders and transporters in the central shed have only 3 year of experience
 and those in the southwest have on average 4 and a half years of experience.
 However, it should be noted that these low figures might suffer from survivor-s
hip bias, as middlemen that go bankrupt disappear from the sample if they
 become farmer again.
 Most middlemen in our sample specialize in milk.

Competition between middlemen is important to prevent them from extracting

.
 We have asked each trader or transporter how many traders or transporters
 have similar trading activities in their trading area.
 We find that there are on average almost 14 other middlemen to compete
 with.
 However, the distribution is skewed, with the median being 8 competitors.
 Still, there is only one person who reports no competition and only 9 that
 report that there is only one other trader or transporter.
 Interestingly, using an Exact Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney Test, we conclude that
 competition is significantly lower in the southwestern area (p<0.001).
 We also asked each trader to estimate how many traders or transporters
 had similar trading activities as in their trading area at the time they
 started trading, which we use to calculate the average yearly increase
 in competition.
 We find that between the time the average middleman started his business
 and now, the number of competitors has increased yearly by about 18 percent.
 There is no difference in increase of competition over time between the
 two areas.

\begin_layout Subsection
Models

\begin_layout Standard
The previous section explores how key innovations within the dairy value
 chain differs between export led and local value chains by simply comparing
 the southwestern milk shed to the central milk shed.
 However, it may be that in the central milk shed, some actors are also
 integrated in an export led value chain.
 For instance, many farmers from the central region supply Brookside in
 Kampala, which exports substantial parts to Kenya.
 Also, Jesa Dairy Ltd in Wakiso procures most of its milk from the central
 shed.
 According to DDA statistics, Jesa also exports considerable amounts of
 milk.
 At the same time, not all actors located in the southwest produce for the
 export market.
 But simply assuming all actors in the southwest are engaged in dairy export
 and all actors in the central region produce for local markets, differences
 between export-led and local value chains may be attenuated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we construct a more fine grained indicator of participation
 in export-led value chains than simply considering milk shed.
 We do this for two actor in the value chain: farmers and traders.
 For farmers, we create an indicator of integration within the export-led
 dairy value chain that is true if the farmer delivered milk to a milk collectio
n center every day during the week before the survey.
 This could either be deliveries made directly, or indirectly through a
 trader or a transporter.
 Using this definition, we find that half of the farmers in our sample are
 integrated into export-led value chains.
 As expected, there is a clear difference between the sheds: in the central
 region, only about 40 percent is part of an export-led value chain.
 In the southwest, this is almost three quarters of the farmers that were
 interviewed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the trader or transporter, we create an indicator of integration within
 the export-led dairy value chain that is true if the trader or transporter
 reports delivering exclusively to an mcc or directly to the processor.
 According to this definition, about 43 percent of traders are integrated
 into export led value chains.
 As for traders, there is a difference between the sheds, with about 38
 percent of farmers integrated in export-led chains in the cental region,
 while this is 62 percent in the southwestern region.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Farmers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the top panel of the table, we present results for dairy farmers.
 The first row looks at the correlation between being integrated in export-led
 dairy value chains and the adoption of improved breeds, defined as the
 share of exotics in the total herd.
 In the first column of the table, means in the subgroup of farmers that
 are not integrated in export led value chains (the control group) are reported.
 We find that the share of exotic animals in the control group is 0.40.
 The second column shows a simple difference between the control group mean
 adoption rate and the average adoption rate among farmers that are integrated
 in export-led value chains.
 We see this is 27 percentage points higher, corresponding to an average
 adoption rate in this group of 0.67.
 The difference is statistically significant at the 1 percent significance
 level.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third column in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Innovations-in-export"

\end_inset

 also shows the difference between the control group and the subset of farmers
 that are part of an international value chain.
 However, we now estimate conditional means in a regression framework.
 In particular, we control for a range of farmer and context characteristics.
 For instance, we add controls for the age of the household head, sex of
 the household head, household size, whether the household head has attended
 at least secondary school, the distance of the farm to the nearest neighbour,
 distance to a shop where veterinary supplies can be bought, access to credit,
 and the size of land that can be used for grazing the animals.
 We also include a set of dummy variables that indicate the district the
 farm is located in
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that this implicitly means we also control for milk shed, as 2 districts
 form the southwestern milk shed and the other four districts belong to
 the central milk shed.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that after controlling for these variables, the difference in adoption
 of improved cows between integration in export led value chains and local
 value chains is still significant.
 However, the difference has reduced to about 12 percent, indicating that
 the simple difference picks up effects that should be attributed to other
 variables.
 Full results for the regression are presented in column 1 of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Regressions-for-farmer"

\end_inset

.
 Most of the control variables in the regression take on the expected sign.
 For instance, we find that older farmers have lower adoption of improved
 cows.
 As we mentioned earlier that especially exotic cows are susceptible to
 pests and diseases, it should not surprise that farmers that are located
 further from veterinary supply shops have lower average adoption rates.
 We also find that access to credit is correlated to higher adoption rates.

Finally, the last column of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Innovations-in-export"

\end_inset

 we present results for the difference in average adoption rates between
 the two groups after making both groups more comparable using propensity
 score matching.
 To estimate the propensity score, we use the same variables as the ones
 we used in the regression model in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Regressions-for-farmer"

\end_inset

.
 We use nearest neigbour matching with a caliper of 0.05
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This means that only comparison units within a certain width of the propensity
 score of the treated units get matched, the distance threshold being .05
 standard deviations of the propensity score.
 While this reduces the number of observations that can be matched, it greatly
 increases balance.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Doing so, we were able to match 374 farmers that participate in export-led
 value chains to 374 farmers that supply local markets.
 Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Balance-on-covariates"

\end_inset

 shows that this procedure improves balance between the sample of farmers
 that is integrated in global value chains and those that are not.
 We again find that farmers that are participating in global value chains
 have on average 12 percentage points higher adoption rates.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second row in the top panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Innovations-in-export"

\end_inset

 shows results for correlations between export led value chains and attention
 to sanitation.
 As in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Milk-handling-and"

\end_inset

, we compare the likelihood that farmers use aluminum buckets to collect
 milk and aluminum cans to store it.
 We see that among farmers that are not part of a global value chain, only
 16 percent reports using proper equipment (column 1).
 This percentage increases to 43 among farmers that report supplying the
 export sector (+27 percentage points, second column).
 In the third column, we again add control variable to estimate conditional
 means.
 This reduces the difference to about 14 percentage points.
 Full results from the regression are reported in the second column of Appendix
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Regressions-for-farmer"

\end_inset

.
 We see that access to credit also partly explains some of the variance
 in the use of aluminum equipment.
 We also conclude larger farms have a higher propensity to use proper equipment,
 while the likelihood is lower if the household head is older.
 The coefficient stays significant and large after matching (column 4).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last row in the top panel shows the association between export led value
 chains and membership of cooperatives.
 It shows that among farmers that are not integrated in export-led value
 chains, 17 percent is member of a dairy cooperative.
 Judged by a simple difference in means, we do find that significantly more
 farmers are member of a cooperative in export led value chains (column
 2).
 However, once we control for a range of observable characteristics, either
 in a regression framework or though propensity score matching, the difference
 disappears.
 Further exploration using regression analysis reveals that, while the coefficie
nt on the indicator dummy for integration into modern value chains is not
 significant, its interaction with the indicator for the southwestern milk
 shed is.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Regressions-for-farmer"

\end_inset

 further reveals that cooperatives are an important vehicle for access to
 credit.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Traders
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bottom part of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Innovations-in-export"

\end_inset

 shows results for a similar analysis using the trader data.
 We start by looking at sanitation at the trader level, defined as the use
 aluminum milk containers for storing and transporting milk in the first
 row.
 We find that in the trader does not exclusively delivers directly to a
 milk collection center or processor, proper equipment is used by only 18
 percent of the traders.
 We find that this percentage is not significantly different among traders
 that are integrated in export-led value chains (column 2).
 In the third column, we report the difference between traders that are
 participating in export value chains and those that are not after controlling
 for observable trader characteristics and environmental variables.
 These controls include age of the trader, sex of the traders, whether the
 trader has attended at least secondary school and whether the trader is
 the head of a household.
 We further control for the number of household members that are in the
 household that the trader is part of, the number of years he or she has
 been operating as a milk trader, and whether he or she reported to have
 access to finance.
 We also add dummies for the different districts where traders operate.
 Full results for the regressions are in Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Regressions-for-trader"

\end_inset

.
 Also according to this model, there is no difference in the use of milk
 cans between traders that are integrated in modern value chains and those
 that trade in the informal sector.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fourth column in the bottom part of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Innovations-in-export"

\end_inset

 reports differences after pre-processing the traders data to increase balance
 on a range of observables using propensity score matching.
 We match on the same variables that were used as controls in the regressions,
 and we again use nearest neigbour matching with a caliper of 0.05.
 Doing so results in a total of 454 observations that were matched, half
 in each group.
 As can be seen in Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Balance-traders"

\end_inset

, this procedure makes both groups comparable on the observed characteristics.
 Comparing mean use of milk cans between traders that are integrated in
 global value chains and those that are not in the matched sample does not
 seem to affect our earlier conclusion that there is no significant difference.
 This finding, together with the large difference observed when we compare
 milk sheds in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Milk-handling-and"

\end_inset

 leads us to conclude that the use of milk cans by traders is primarily
 related to geographic location.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second row in the bottom panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Innovations-in-export"

\end_inset

 looks at the likelihood that a trader is member of a cooperative or a union.
 We find that about 41 of traders that are part of the local dairy value
 chain are member of a cooperative or union.
 Simply comparing traders that are integrated in export oriented value chains
 to those that are not, we find no difference in membership.
 However, after controlling for other characteristics in a regression (column
 3), the difference becomes significantly negative, albeit only at the 10
 percent significance level.
 The result is not very robust and disappears again when using propensity
 score matching.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next rows in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Innovations-in-export"

\end_inset

 present results on the degree of specialization among traders.
 In particular, we look at the likelihood that farmers transport only milk
 against a transport fee (as opposed to (also) transporting or trading other
 dairy products or even other crops).
 We find that about 35 percent of traders that are integrated in local value
 chains specialize in milk according to this definition.
 We find that this is about 13 percentage points higher among farmers that
 are supplying the export sector (column 2), and this difference remains
 after controlling for a range of observable characteristics (column 3).
 Full regression results, reported in column 3 in Appendix Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Regressions-for-trader"

\end_inset

 show that the likelihood of specialization is also correlated to many of
 these other characteristics.
 For instance, we especially you and lower educated traders specialize in
 milk transportation.
 The fact that being the head is negatively correlated to specialization
 can be explained by the fact that farmers often use relatives (their son)
 to transport milk.
 Traders that have access to credit are more likely to buy and sell for
 their own account, instead of merely transporting against a fee for someone
 else.
 The difference in the degree of specialization between the two trader groups
 becomes even larger after matching.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we consider the number of other traders or transporters that work
 in the area the trader usually works.
 Consistent with what we found in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Specialization"

\end_inset

, the average trader that is integrated in local supply chains competes
 with about 14 other traders (column 1).
 However, the number of competitors is significantly lower if reported by
 traders that are working in export-led value chains.
 While the difference reduces somewhat after controlling for obserables,
 it remains significant at the 10 percent significance level.
 Finally, we asked if traders have agreements with other traders on what
 prices to offer to farmers, as a proxy for the extent of price fixing that
 prevails in the diary value chain.
 Despite the fact that competition seems to be lower among traders that
 work in export-led value chains, price fixing seems to be substantially
 lower as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a result of increased demand for dairy products, both locally and from
 abroad, and facilitated by privatization and liberalization, the dairy
 sub-sector in Uganda has transformed substantially.
 Using data collected from farmers, traders, milk collection centers and
 processors, we highlight some of the differences and similarities between
 the central milk shed that caters for the local market and the southwestern
 milk shed that supplies the processors that produce for the export market.
 We also explore patterns in key innovations that are both a cause and consequen
ce of transforming value chains.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find seasonality to be a defining feature of dairy farming in Uganda.
 During the rainy season, almost twice as much milk is produced than during
 the dry season.
 This seasonality cuts across the entire value chain.
 In the dry season in the central milk shed, transporters make trips with
 milk cans that are only half full, while in the southern milk shed during
 the rainy season, traders make more than 2.5 trips.
 At the level of milk collection centers, there is considerable under-use
 of this capacity in the dry season, especially in the central milk shed,
 where tanks are on average only 30 percent full.
 Processors complain they can not source sufficient milk, yet they keep
 increasing capacity.
 Prices are relatively high in both sheds during the dry season.
 In rainy season, prices decrease substantially, especially in the southwestern
 milk shed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second important finding that emerges from this study is that increased
 specialization and a reduction in the number of smallholder traders does
 not necessarily mean farmers profit less from diary value chains.
 Indeed, we find that in modern value chains, transporters are less likely
 to engage in price fixing than in informal market where traders work for
 their own account.
 Apparently, prices are determined as a competitive process at the processor
 level, closely tracking the international milk price.
 Actors upstream seem to follow this price, and in the context of frequent
 transactions and a commodity where quality is important, a stable trading
 relationship seems important.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Third, while for other commodities, prices when sold to neigbours are low,
 this is not the case for milk.
 In fact, we find that in the central region, farmers get the best prices
 when they sell directly to fellow villagers.
 This illustrates the importance of the local milk market.
 However, the existence of a local market for which there are less quality
 requirements may hamper (further) development of the dairy value chain.
 For instance, processors may be reluctant to invest in processors (eg.
 by organizing training, providing credit or inputs), if there is a high
 likelihood that the farmer will sell the milk in the local market instead
 of to the processor 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We further establish that technology adoption is correlated with being integrate
d in global value chains.
 In the southwestern milk shed, almost 87 percent of animals are of an improved
 breed.
 The central milk shed, half of the cows are still local varieties.
 We also see correlations with milk sanitation: Throughout the dairy value
 chain, custom milk containers are becoming the norm in the export led milk
 shed.
 There are also innovations in terms of how parts of the chain is organized:
 in the export oriented milk shed, proportionally more producers report
 that they are a member of a dairy cooperative.
 Also at the level of the milk collection centers, we also see that cooperatives
 are more prevalent in the southwest.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though we try to reduce bias due to selection inherent to observational
 data by conditioning on a range of observables using regression and propensity
 score matching, it should be stressed that the dairy value chain innovations
 we consider in this study are endogenous: innovations happen in response
 to transforming value chains while at the same time, these same innovations
 lead to a transformation of the value chain.
 Therefore, our results can not be interpreted as the causal effect of export-le
d value chains on technology adoption, sanitation, or aspects of industrial
 organization such as cooperative membership and specialization.
